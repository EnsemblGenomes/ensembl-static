**About *Culicoides brevitarsis***
-------------------------
Flies are insects of the order Diptera, the name being derived from 
the Greek δι- di- "two", and πτερόν pteron "wing". Insects of this 
order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings having 
evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which 
act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans 
to perform advanced aerobatics. Diptera is a large order containing 
more than 150,000 species including horse-flies, crane flies, 
hoverflies, mosquitoes and others.
