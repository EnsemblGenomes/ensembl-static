**About *Bombus affinis***
-------------------------
*Bombus affinis*, commonly known as the rusty patched bumble bee, is a 
species of bumblebee endemic to North America. Its historical range in 
North America has been throughout the east and upper Midwest of the 
United States, north to Ontario, Canada, where it is considered a 
"species at risk", east to Quebec, south to Georgia, and west to the 
Dakotas. Its numbers have declined in 87% of its historical habitat 
range. On January 10, 2017, the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service placed B. affinis on the list of endangered species, making 
the rusty patched bumblebee the first bee to be added to the list in 
the continental United States.
