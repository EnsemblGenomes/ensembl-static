**About *Bombus huntii***
-------------------------
*Bombus huntii* is a species of bumblebee. It is native to western 
North America, where it occurs in western Canada and the United States 
as far east as Manitoba and Minnesota, and in Mexico as far south as 
the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. It is known commonly as the Hunt 
bumblebee or Hunt's bumblebee.

This bee lives in desert scrub, prairies, and meadows. In the southern
part of its range in Mexico it lives in pine ecosystems and it can be
found at high elevations, such as the tops of tall volcanoes. The bee is
active in summer and fall, and in southern areas it flies throughout
much of the year. It nests underground.

Food plants visited by this species include rabbitbrush, thistles,
sunflowers, penstemons, phacelias, currants, rudbeckias, and clovers.

This bumblebee is susceptible to certain viruses that infect honey bees,
such as Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV)[3] and Deformed Wing Virus
(DWV) [1]. Experiments suggest that this and other native species make efficient
pollinators of crop plants such as tomatoes, and that commercial rearing
would be a viable alternative to introducing non-native bees for the
purpose [2].
