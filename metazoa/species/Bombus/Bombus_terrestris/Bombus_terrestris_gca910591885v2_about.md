**About *Bombus terrestris***
-------------------------
*Bombus terrestris*, the buff-tailed bumblebee (*Bombus terrestris*) 
or large earth bumblebee, is one of the most numerous bumblebee 
species in Europe. It is one of the main species used in greenhouse 
pollination, and so can be found in many countries and areas where it 
is not native, such as Tasmania. Moreover, it is a eusocial insect 
with an overlap of generations, a division of labor, and cooperative 
brood care. The queen is monandrous which means she mates with only 
one male. B. terrestris workers learn flower colors and forage 
efficiently.
