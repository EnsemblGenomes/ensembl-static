**About *Apis florea***
-------------------------
The dwarf honey bee, *Apis florea*, is one of two species of small, 
wild honey bees of southern and southeastern Asia. It has a much wider 
distribution than its sister species, Apis andreniformis. First 
identified in the late 18th century, Apis florea is unique for its 
morphology, foraging behavior and defensive mechanisms like making a 
piping noise. Apis florea have open nests and small colonies, which 
makes them more susceptible to predation than cavity nesters with 
large numbers of defensive workers. These honey bees are important 
pollinators and therefore commodified in countries like Cambodia.
