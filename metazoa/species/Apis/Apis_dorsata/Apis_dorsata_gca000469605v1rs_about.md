**About *Apis dorsata***
-------------------------
*Apis dorsata*, the giant honey bee, is a honey bee of South and 
Southeast Asia, found mainly in forested areas such as the Terai of 
Nepal. They are typically around 17–20 mm (0.7–0.8 in) long. Nests are 
mainly built in exposed places far off the ground, like on tree limbs, 
under cliff overhangs, and sometimes on buildings. These social bees 
are known for their aggressive defense strategies and vicious behavior 
when disturbed. Though not domesticating it, indigenous peoples have 
traditionally used this species as a source of honey and beeswax, a 
practice known as honey hunting.
