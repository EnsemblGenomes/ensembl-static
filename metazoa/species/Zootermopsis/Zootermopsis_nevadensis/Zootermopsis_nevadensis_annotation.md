The protein-coding genes in Ensembl Metazoa were imported from
[INSDC](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/proteins/17755?genome_assembly_id=202381&gi=639535876),
and are a subset of the Official Gene Set v2.2 available from the
[*Zootermopsis nevadensis* Genome Project](http://termitegenome.org).
Non-coding RNA genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed.
