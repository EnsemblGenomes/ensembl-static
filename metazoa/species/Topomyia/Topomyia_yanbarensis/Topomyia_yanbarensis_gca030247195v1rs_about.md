**About *Topomyia yanbarensis***
-------------------------
Thopomyia is a genus of flies in the family Stratiomyidae. Thopomyia are part of the 
subfamily Culicinae which are the most extensive subfamily of mosquitoes and have 
species in every continent except Antarctica, but are highly concentrated in tropical 
areas. Mosquitoes are best known as parasites to many vertebrate animals and vectors for 
disease. They are holometabolous insects, and most species lay their eggs in stagnant 
water, to benefit their aquatic larval stage.
