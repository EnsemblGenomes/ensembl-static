Hylaeus is a large (over 500 species) and diverse cosmopolitan genus 
within the bee family Colletidae. This genus is also known as the

Hylaeus anthracinus is colored black and of medium size. Its legs are black and 
the wings are clearish. Males have a large facial yellow spot whereas females 
are completely black.

*Hylaeus anthracinus* is a species of bee, also known by the common

from only 16 populations. In September 2016, along with six other 
Hawaiian Hylaeus species, *H. anthracinus* was listed for protection 
under the United States Endangered Species Act. This marked a first
