**Assembly**
------------------------

The *Trialeurodes vaporariorum* genome was sequenced by [Genetron Health](https://en.genetronhealth.com/). The draft assembly was produced from sequencing data comprising 82 and 131-fold coverage respectively for long PacBio reads and Illumina shotgun reads. The final genome sequence of *T. vaporariorum* that had a total length of 787.4 Mb, and contained 397 scaffolds and 3,573 contigs with N50 lengths of 70 Mb and 500 kb, respectively.

Prior to the publication of the recently released genome sequence for *T. vaporariorum* in 2020[1], an initial genome sequence was released in 2019 [2]. This previously published genome had relatively low contiguity and scaffold N50. Ensembl Metazoa uses the most recent genome release[1] which was assembled using both short/long insert PacBio long reads and Hi-C chromatin interaction maps to generate a near chromosome-level assembly.
