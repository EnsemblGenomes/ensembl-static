**About *Trialeurodes vaporariorum***
------------------------

Greenhouse whitefly *Trialeurodes vaporariorum* are found predominantly in temperate regions but have a worldwide distribution. They are known to be vectors for hundreds of plant viruses [1,2], while also being resistant to a number of different insecticide groups. *T. vaporariorum* are primary insect pests for many agricultural and horticultural crops including fruits, vegetables and ornamental flowers. Adults are ~1.5 mm long but range 1-2 mm in length, white and are said to resemble tiny moths. The wings are a pale yellow, held relatively flat in relation to the leaf surface and are coated with a pure white waxy bloom giving them a 'dusted' appearance.

*T. vaporariorum* are closely related to another group of important agricultural pests the 'silverleaf whitefly' (Bemisia tabaci). Although less prominent disease vectors relative to Bemisia; *T. vaporariorum genomic* resources are invaluable to further develop the understanding of insect-arbovirus biology and development of integrated global pest management systems.
