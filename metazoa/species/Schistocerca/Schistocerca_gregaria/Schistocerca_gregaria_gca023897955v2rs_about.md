**About *Schistocerca gregaria***
-------------------------
The desert locust is a species of locust, a periodically swarming, 
short-horned grasshopper in the family Acrididae. They are found 
primarily in the deserts and dry areas of northern and eastern Africa, 
Arabia, and southwest Asia. During population surge years, they may 
extend north into parts of western Spain and southern Italy, south 
into Eastern Africa, and east in northern India. The desert locust 
shows periodic changes in its body form and can change in response to 
environmental conditions, over several generations, from a solitary, 
shorter-winged, highly fecund, non-migratory form to a gregarious, 
long-winged, and migratory phase in which they may travel long 
distances into new areas. In some years, they may thus form locust 
plagues, invading new areas, where they may consume all vegetation 
including crops, and at other times, they may live unnoticed in small 
numbers.
