**About *Schistocerca cancellata***
-------------------------
*Schistocerca cancellata* is a species of locust in the subfamily 
Cyrtacanthacridinae. It is the major swarming species in subtropical 
South America. This species shows typical locust phase polymorphism. 
Solitarious nymphs are green, but gregarious ones are yellow with a 
black pattern. There are morphological differences between solitarious 
and gregarious adults. For many years the two phases were believed to 
be different species and the gregarious form was mistakenly identified 
as S. paranensis.

The solitary phase is found in South America between 18°S and 35°S. 
Plagues originate in a desert and semi-desert zona permanente in NW 
Argentina, SE Bolivia and W Paraguay, when good rains allow successful 
breeding, followed by gregarisation. Swarms of gregarious adults may 
then migrate into crop growing regions.
