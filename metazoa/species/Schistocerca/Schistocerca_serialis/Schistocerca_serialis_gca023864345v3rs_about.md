**About *Schistocerca serialis cubense***
-------------------------
*Schistocerca* [1] is a genus of grasshoppers, commonly called bird grasshoppers, many of which swarm as locusts. The best known species is probably the desert locust (*S. gregaria*) and trans-Atlantic
flight may explain the biogeography of some locust species.[2]. *S. serialis* was first described in 1815 [3].
