About *Necator americanus*
------------------------------

The hookworm *Necator americanus* is a parasitic nematode commonly known as the New World hookworm. Hookworms infect around 700 million people globally, causing a disease burden of 1.5-22.1 million disability-adjusted life years. Around 85% of all hookworm infections in humans are coming from this species causing Necatoriasis, a disease characterised by impairment of development in children, anaemia and malnutrition in pregnant women.

Unembryonated *Necator americanus* eggs are passed in the stool and under favourable conditions the larvae hatch in soil. After maturating in the soil, the larvae becomes infective and in contact with the human host, typically bare feet, penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream. After being carried to the lungs, they make it up to the bronchial tree and are swallowed. Larvae then reach the jejunum of the small intestine, where they mature into adults.
