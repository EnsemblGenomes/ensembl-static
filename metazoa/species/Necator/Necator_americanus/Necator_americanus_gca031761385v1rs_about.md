**About *Necator americanus***
-------------------------
*Necator americanus* is a species of hookworm commonly known as the 
New World hookworm (*Necator americanus*). Like other hookworms, it is 
a member of the phylum Nematoda. It is an obligatory parasitic 
nematode that lives in the small intestine of human hosts. 
Necatoriasis—a type of helminthiasis—is the term for the condition of 
being host to an infestation of a species of Necator. Since N. 
americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale are the two species of hookworms 
that most commonly infest humans, they are usually dealt with under 
the collective heading of "hookworm infection". They differ most 
obviously in geographical distribution, structure of mouthparts, and 
relative size.
