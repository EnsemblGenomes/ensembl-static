**About *Wyeomyia smithii***
-------------------------
*Wyeomyia smithii*, the pitcher plant mosquito, is an inquiline 
mosquito that completes its pre-adult life cycle in the phytotelma 
of—that is, the water contained by—the purple pitcher plant, 
Sarracenia purpurea. In this microcommunity of bacteria, rotifers, 
protozoa, and midges, W. smithii is the top-level predator; its 
presence determines the bacterial species diversity within the 
pitcher.
