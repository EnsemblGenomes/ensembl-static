**About *Lutzomyia longipalpis***
-------------------------
*Lutzomyia longipalpis* is a species complex of sandfly belonging to 
the family Psychodidae. This species is primarily present in Central 
and South America, but has also appeared in Mexico. There have been 
reports of L. longipalpis as far south as Argentina, as they are found 
in a wide variety of ecological conditions. Both males and females 
feed on sugars from plants and aphids, but only adult females feed on 
the blood of other mammals. The species has recently begun appearing 
in urban areas throughout Brazil, and serves as a key vessel for the 
propagation of the parasite Leishmania infantum. The presence of these 
flies appears to be strongly correlated to the presence of domestic 
chickens in Latin America. The first major urban outbreak of the 
lethal Visceral leishmanias epidemic was detected in Teresina, Piauí 
State in the early 1980s following a massive planting of acacias.
