**About *Sitophilus oryzae***
-------------------------
The rice weevil (*Sitophilus oryzae*) is a stored product pest which 
attacks seeds of several crops, including wheat, rice, and maize.
The adults are usually between 3 and 4.6 mm long, with a long snout.

Female *S. oryzae* use strong mandibles to chew a hole into a grain kernel 
after which she deposits a single egg within the hole, sealing it 
with secretions from her ovipositor. The larva develops within the 
grain, hollowing it out while feeding. It then pupates within the 
grain kernel and emerges 2â€“4 days after eclosion.
