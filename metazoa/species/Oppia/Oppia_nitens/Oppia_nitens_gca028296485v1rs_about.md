**About *Oppia nitens***
-------------------------
**Oribatida** (formerly Cryptostigmata), also known as **oribatid mites**, **moss mites** or **beetle mites**,[1] are an order of mites, 
in the "chewing Acariformes" clade Sarcoptiformes. They range in size from 0.2 to 1.4 millimetres (0.008 to 0.055 in) [1].
There are currently 12,000 species that have been identified, but researchers estimate that there may be anywhere from 60,000 
to 120,000 total species [2]. Oribatid mites are by far the most prevalent of all arthropods in forest soils, and are essential
for breaking down organic detritus and distributing fungi [3]. The Oribatida are of economic importance as hosts of various tapeworm species,
and by increasing the breakdown of organic material in the soil, in a similar manner to earthworms.[4]
