**About *Myopa tessellatipennis***
-------------------------

*Myopa tessellatipennis* is a species of fly from the genus *Myopa* in the family Conopidae, also known as the thick-headed flies. 
They are parasitic on honey bees Apis mellifera, also Andrena, and mustache bees Anthophora. Flies of the family Conopidae are 
distributed worldwide in all the biogeographic realms except for the poles and many of the Pacific islands. About 800 species 
in 47 genera are described worldwide, about 70 of which are found in North America. The majority of conopids are black and yellow, 
or black and white, and often strikingly resemble wasps, bees, or flies of the family Syrphidae, themselves notable 
bee mimics. A conopid is most frequently found at flowers, feeding on nectar with its proboscis, which is often long.
