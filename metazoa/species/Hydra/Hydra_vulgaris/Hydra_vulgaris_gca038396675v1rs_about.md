**About *Hydra vulgaris***
-------------------------
*Hydra vulgaris*, the fresh-water polyp, is a small freshwater hydroid 
with length from 10 mm to 30 mm and width about 1mm.

*H. vulgaris* is often used, like many hydra, as a model organism for morphallactic 
regeneration because they are easy to care for, requiring minimal direct care, 
and reproduce relatively quickly. It is reported that they do not undergo 
senescence, making them biologically immortal although this has been disputed.
