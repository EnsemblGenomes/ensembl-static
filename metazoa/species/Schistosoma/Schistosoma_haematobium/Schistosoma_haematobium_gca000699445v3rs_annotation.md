**Annotation**
----------

metazoa displaying genes imported from GenBank entry linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_000699445.3](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000699445.3).

Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by ["The University of Melbourne"](URL_GOES_HERE).

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [metazoa](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
