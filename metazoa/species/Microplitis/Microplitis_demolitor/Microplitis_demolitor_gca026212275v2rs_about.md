**About *Microplitis demolitor***
-------------------------
Microplitis is a genus of braconid wasps in the family Braconidae. There are more than 190 
described species in Microplitis, found throughout the world.

*Microplitis demolitor* is a parasitoid wasp in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. It is 
native to eastern Australia but has been introduced into the United States as a biological 
control agent [1]. *M. demolitor* parasitizes several species of Lepidoptera that are 
important agricultural pests including *Helicoverpa punctigera*, *H. armigera*, and *Chrysodeixis 
includens* [1,2]. Female *M. demolitor* parasitize the larval stage of host species by laying one 
or more eggs into the body cavity (hemocoel). After hatching, wasp larvae develop by primarily 
feeding on blood. Usually a single mature wasp larva emerges from the host in 7-8 days to spin 
a cocoon and pupate followed by emergence of an adult wasp several days later.

Like most Hymenoptera, *M. demolitor* is haplo-diploid with unfertilized eggs developing into 
males and fertilized eggs developing into females [3]. *M. demolitor* also belongs to a complex 
in the family Braconidae that carry symbiotic viruses in the genus Bracovirus [4]. *M. demolitor* 
bracovirus (MdBV) persists as a provirus in every individual while replicating specifically in females. 
Female M. demolitor inject MdBV into hosts when laying eggs. The virus thereafter infects different 
cells of the host larva and expresses genes that the wasp offspring rely upon for successful 
development [5].
