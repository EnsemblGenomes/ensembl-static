**About *Paramacrobiotus metropolitanus***
-------------------------

*Paramacrobiotus* is a genus Eutardigrade. Tardigrades, known colloquially as water bears or moss piglets, are a phylum of 
eight-legged segmented micro-animals. They were first described by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773, 
who called them Kleiner Wasserb√§r. In 1777, the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani named them Tardigrada, which means 
"slow steppers".

Tardigrades, or water bears, are particularly attractive animal models to study the different kinds of dormancy owing to their 
ability to enter anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis [1], and can tolerate harsh conditions such as extreme temperature and pressure 
(high and low), ionizing and ultraviolet (UV) radiations, osmotic stress, and even space vacuum at low Earth orbit. Members of the 
genus *Paramacrobiotus* have been shown to exhibit the natural occurring autofluorescence under UV light with potential to confer 
tolerance to lethal UV radiation [2].
