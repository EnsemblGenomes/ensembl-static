Assembly
--------

*Rhodnius prolixus* was sequenced by the Washington University School of
Medicine, Genome Sequencing Center
([WUGSC](http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/detail/rhodnius-prolixus)) to a
depth of 8.1x coverage, and assembled using the CABOG assembler. DNA was
isolated from the colony at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
USA. WGS sequence was released to GenBank in April 2015:
[ACPB00000000.3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ACPB00000000.3).
This assembly version RproC3, also known as Rhodnius\_prolixus-3.0.3, is
linked to the assembly accession [GCA\_000181055.3](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000181055.3).

The total length of the assembly is 706824083 bp contained within 16537 scaffolds.
The scaffold N50 value is 1088772, the scaffold L50 value is 170.
The GC% content of the assembly is 34.0%.
