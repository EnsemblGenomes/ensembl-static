Annotation
----------

The annotation of the *Rhodnius prolixus* genome has been conducted by
[VectorBase](https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/search/dataset/AllDatasets/result?filterTerm=GCA_000181055.3).
Genes were predicted using the Ensembl pipeline, which combines the
results from *ab initio* predictions from Genscan and SNAP, alignments
of dipteran and other protein sets, and *R. prolixus* ESTs. The geneset
presented here (RproC3.4, July 2019) includes annotation by the
Rhodnius community to improve and validate gene models and non-coding
RNA genes from the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
