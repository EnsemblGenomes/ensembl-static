**About *Penaeus chinensis***
-------------------------
The Chinese white shrimp, oriental shrimp, or fleshy prawn is a 
species of shrimp. It is cultivated at an industrial level off 
mainland China. Production was devastated by a series of epidemics in 
the 1990s and early 2000s. Its wild capture has since recovered and 
expanded, but it is now farmed at lower levels than previously.
