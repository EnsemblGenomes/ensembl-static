About *Clytia hemisphaerica*
------------------------

_Clytia hemisphaerica_ is a hydrozoan–group cnidarian with both a colonial, vegetatively propagating polyp stage and free-living, sexual medusae. The evolutionary interest of the medusa lies in many complex features including striated muscle and sense organs that are absent in the polyp. In recent years, _Clytia_ has helped answer questions including regulation of oocyte maturation, origins of embryo polarity and evolution of Hox genes and striated muscle.[1,2]
