The *Clytia hemisphaerica*  gene models were provided as GFF3 file by the
[MARIMBA (Marine Invertebrate Models Database)](http://marimba.obs-vlfr.fr/) project. Non-coding RNA genes were added with the [Ensembl Genomes RNA gene annotation pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
