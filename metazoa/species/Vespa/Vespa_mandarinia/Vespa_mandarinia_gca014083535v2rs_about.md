**About *Vespa mandarinia***
-------------------------
The Asian giant hornet (*Vespa mandarinia*), also known as the 
northern giant hornet, and the Japanese giant hornet, is the world's 
largest hornet. It is native to temperate and tropical East Asia, 
South Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and parts of the Russian Far 
East. It was also found in the Pacific Northwest of North America in 
late 2019 with a few more additional sightings in 2020, and nests 
found in 2021, prompting concern that it could become an invasive 
species, but in December 2024, it was announced that the hornets had 
been eradicated from the region as well as from the rest of the United 
States.
