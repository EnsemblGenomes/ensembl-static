**About *Lepeophtheirus salmonis***
-------------------------
The **salmon louse**, *Lepeophtheirus salmonis* is a species of 
copepod in the genus Lepeophtheirus. It is a sea louse, a parasite 
living mostly on salmon, particularly on Pacific and Atlantic salmon 
and sea trout, but is also sometimes found on the three-spined 
stickleback. It feeds on the mucus, skin and blood 
of the fish. Once detached, they can be blown by wind across the 
surface of the sea, like plankton. When they encounter a suitable 
marine fish host, they adhere themselves to the skin, fins, or gills 
of the fish, and feed on the mucus or skin. Sea lice only affect fish 
and are not harmful to humans.
