Annotation
----------

Annotation of the AgamP4 assembly was carried out by VEuPathDB VectorBase. The set
of gene models presented (genebuild AgamP4.14, released August 2022)
combines manual annotation, data provided by the research community, and
gene prediction using the Ensembl system. Prediction utilised alignments
of dipteran and other protein sets to the genome and generation of
GeneWise models, alignment and gene prediction based on Anopheles ESTs,
and selected *ab initio* predictions. More details can be found in
