**About *Anopheles coluzzii***
-------------------------

*Anopheles coluzzii*, formerly known as *Anopheles gambiae* *M*
molecular form, was defined as a separate species in 2013 [1].
*An. coluzzii* belongs to the *Anopheles gambiae* species complex, which
consists of at least seven species.

The Anopheles gambiae complex consists of at least seven 
morphologically indistinguishable species of mosquitoes in the genus 
Anopheles. The complex was recognised in the 1960s and includes the 
most important vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly 
of the most dangerous malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. It is 
one of the most efficient malaria vectors known. The An. gambiae 
mosquito additionally transmits Wuchereria bancrofti which causes 
lymphatic filariasis, a symptom of which is elephantiasis.
