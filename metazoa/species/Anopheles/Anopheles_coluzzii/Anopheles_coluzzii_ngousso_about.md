*Ngousso* strain
----------------

The *Ngousso* colony was created in 2006 from the broods of
approximately 100 wild-caught pure An. coluzzii females in Cameroon
([\"A High-Quality De novo Genome Assembly from a Single Mosquito Using
PacBio
Sequencing\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6357164/),
Kingan et al, Genes 2019, 10, 62; doi:10.3390/genes10010062 ). The
colony is partially inbred, and has been used extensively in
experimental infection studies.
