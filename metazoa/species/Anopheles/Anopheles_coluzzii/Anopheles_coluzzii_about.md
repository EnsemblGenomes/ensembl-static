*Mali-NIH* strain
-----------------

The *Anopheles gambiae* *M* *Mali-NIH* colony was established from
blood-fed adult females collected resting inside houses in Niono, Mali
in November 2005. Approximately 80 isofemale families molecularly
identified as *An. gambiae* M form were used to establish the colony,
which was subsequently karyotyped as *2Rbc/bc;* *2La/a*. The *A.
gambiae* M Mali-NIH colony is currently maintained from the [BEI
resources](https://www.beiresources.org) web portal.
