Annotation
----------

Annotation of the *Anopheles darlingi* assembly was carried out by the
LNCC using a mixture of ab initio and similarity approaches including a
small EST project. The geneset presented here (AdarC3.8, October 2018)
includes non-coding RNA genes from the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html) and community
annotation patch build.
