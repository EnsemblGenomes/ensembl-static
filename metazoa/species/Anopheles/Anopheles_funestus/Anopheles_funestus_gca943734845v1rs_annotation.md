**Annotation**
----------

Ensembl Metazoa displaying genes imported from GenBank entry linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_943734845.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_943734845.1).

Genomic annotation was deposited along with assembly deposited to the INSDC by [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/).

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [Ensembl Metazoa](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
