**About *Anopheles atroparvus***
------------------------

**Range**

*Anopheles atroparvus* belongs to the A. maculipennis species complex. Current suitability studies 
indicate that habitat and climate in 21st century Europe are extensively appropriate for *A. atroparvus*, 
being distributed in northern and western Europe, Spain (including the Canary Islands), Portugal and 
northern Italy and was one of the main malaria vectors in Europe. However the speceis has known ranges 
covering: Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, 
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia & Slovakia, 
Slovenia, Sweden and Ukraine. *Anopheles atroparvus* was the most abundant species of the 
*A. maculipennis* complex found in south-east England [5]. Flight range of *A. atroparvus* is suggested 
to be at least three kilometres [1]. *A. atroparvus* hibernate as adult females, often seeking shelter 
indoor in stables or man-made dwellings during the autumn where they can remain active [1]. 


**Vectoral capacity**

Although research interest in *A. atroparvus* has been low in the past several decades, recent concern 
for an increase in vector-borne disease has encouraged new research into this species. The current dominant 
Anopheles vector species in Europe and the Mediterranean includes *A. atroparvus*, among other species of 
Anopheles[4]. *Anopheles atroparvus*, the dominant vector in large parts of Europe, might play an important 
role with respect to changes of the potential transmission stability[6]. *Anopheles atroparvus* is generally 
considered as primarily zoophilic, however, it has also been described as anthropophilic, with host 
choice dependednt on availability thus reflecting the opportunistic nature of this species. Implicated in the 
transmission of autochhtonous malaria in Europe via the human malaria parasite *Plasmodium vivax*; and known 
to be involved in winter transmission of malaria at the start of the twentieth century in Britain, coastal 
areas in the Netherlands and Germany[2] and elsewhere in Europe[1]. In Portugal, *Anopheles atroparvus* 
is the only mosquito species implicated in malaria transmission[3].
