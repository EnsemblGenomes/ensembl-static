About *Ascaris suum*
---------------------

*Ascaris* is a genus of parasitic nematodes that can cause infections in humans and pigs. The roundworm *Ascaris suum*, is an intestinal parasite of pigs causing ascariasis and it has been characterised as the most damaging worm of swine. It is also known as the “large roundworm of pig”. Ascariasis is a soil-transmitted infection caused by ingesting the eggs of *Ascaris suum*. After a maturation process which takes place in the intestines, liver and lungs, the larvae will get swallowed again and will end up in the small intestine where the adult worms will emerge. Ascariasis in pigs is causing an increased feed to gain ratio and liver condemnation, while the migration of larvae through the lungs has been associated with secondary bacterial infections and cute respiratory symptoms in pigs. The eggs produced by the adult worms, which end up in the feces, and are extremely resistant to environmental conditions and disinfectants, remaining infective in the environment for years.

*A. suum* is closely related to *A. lumbricoides*, the human large roundworm parasite, one of the most common human parasitic infections in the world. Cross infections of *A. suum* to humans and *A. lumbricoides* to pigs have been reported.
