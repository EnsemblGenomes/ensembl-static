**About *Cataglyphis hispanica***
-------------------------

*Cataglyphis* is a genus of ant, desert ants, in the subfamily
Formicinae. Its most famous species is *C. bicolor*, the Sahara Desert
ant, which runs on hot sand to find insects that died of heat
exhaustion, and can, like other several other Cataglyphis species,
sustain body temperatures up to 50Â°C.

Species of this genus are behaviourally, morphologically, and
physiologically adapted to dry and hot habitats.

At least five different species of *Cataglyphis* occur in the Sahara
Desert, which may be considered the center of distribution for this
genus. Five species also occur in Israel. Some species reach
into southern Russia, southern Spain, Greece, the former
Yugoslavia, Hungary, the European part of Turkey, and the Aral-Caspian
area near Tijanchan.
