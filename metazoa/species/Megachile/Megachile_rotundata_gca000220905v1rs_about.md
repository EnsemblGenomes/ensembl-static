**About *Megachile rotundata***
-------------------------
*Megachile rotundata*, the alfalfa leafcutting bee (*Megachile 
rotundata*), is a European bee that has been introduced to various 
regions around the world. As a solitary bee species, it does not build 
colonies or store honey, but is a very efficient pollinator of 
alfalfa, carrots, other vegetables, and some fruits. Because of this, 
farmers often use M. rotundata as a pollination aid by distributing M. 
rotundata prepupae around their crops. Each female constructs and 
provisions her own nest, which is built in old trees or log tunnels. 
Being a leafcutter bee, these nests are lined with cut leaves. These 
bees feed on pollen and nectar and display sexual dimorphism. This 
species has been known to bite and sting, but it poses no overall 
danger unless it is threatened or harmed, and its sting has been 
described as half as painful as a honey bee's.
