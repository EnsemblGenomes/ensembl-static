***Bemisia tabaci* Sub-Saharan Africa 1-Subgroup 1 Nigeria**
------------------------
Whiteflies of the *Bemisia tabaci* (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) species complex are phloem-feeding insects and plant-virus vectors, some of which are widely regarded to be amongst the worldâ€™s worst agricultural pests. Outbreaks of *B. tabaci* cause significant crop losses and contribute to global food insecurity.

Two devastating diseases affecting cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), an important food security crop in sub-Saharan Africa, are spread by abundant populations of cassava whiteflies, most notably the cryptic species termed *B. tabaci* Sub-Saharan Africa 1-Subgroup 1 (SSA1-SG1) [1]. This species is currently widespread in East Africa and has recently been reported in eastern Nigeria [2], although populations there do not yet reach excessive numbers. 

The genome described here was generated from a Nigerian population of *B. tabaci* SSA1-SG1, that was inbred in the laboratory to reduce heterozygosity. 

**The *Bemisia tabaci* cryptic species complex**
------------------------
Members of the *B. tabaci* species complex cause plant damage by feeding on plant-phloem sap, inducing phytotoxic disorders, depositing honeydew on which sooty moulds develop and by vectoring > 300 plant-virus species in the genera *Begomovirus*, *Carlavirus*, *Crinivirus*, *Ipomovirus*, *Polerovirus* and *Torradovirus* [3,4]. Diseases caused by these viruses often spread rapidly with devastating yield losses of up to 100% [5]. 

*Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* currently represents a relatively large group (>44) of mostly unresolved cryptic species, as inferred from phylogenetic species delimitation studies [6,7]. These morphologically indistinguishable species differ from one another not only in their genetic relatedness, but also in various biological traits such as plant host-range breadth, fecundity, insecticide resistance, and plant-virus transmission efficiencies.

*Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* are distributed globally, from tropical to temperate climatic zones and across all continents (except Antarctica) [6]. Most cryptic species in this complex, as currently understood, are geographically restricted, but two of them are highly invasive globally i.e., *B. tabaci* Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1, also referred to as biotype B and *Bemisia argentifolii*) and *B. tabaci* Mediterranean (MED, also referred to as biotype Q) [6]. *Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* live predominantly on herbaceous plant hosts and have been recorded from an exceedingly broad range of host plants (>500 species) [8]. The documented host-plant range of most cryptic species within the complex remains largely incomplete.
