**Assembly**
------------------------
The *Bemisia tabaci* SSA2 genome was produced by the genomics consortium of the [African Cassava Whitefly Project](http://www.cassavawhitefly.org), funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant Number OPP1058938).

A field colony collected by [Dr Ibrahim U. Mohammed](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=tQov6toAAAAJ&hl=en) (Argungu, Kebbi State, Nigeria) was established, maintained and inbred (F6 generation) by [Dr Joachim Nwezeobi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joachimnwezeobi/?originalSubdomain=uk) at the quarantine insectary facilities of the [Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, United Kingdom](https://www.nri.org/).

High-molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from a pooled sample of F6 inbred haploid male individuals (n=3000). PacBio Sequel library construction and sequencing (8 SMRT cells) were performed by the [Centre for Genomic Research, The University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/genomic-research/) (United Kingdom).

The current assembly of the *B. tabaci* SSA2 genome was generated by [Dr Lahcen Campbell](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=zZ14f3EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, UK). The length of the *B. tabaci* SSA2 genome assembly was 625.3 Mb, housed in 785 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 7.81Mb. The assembly was produced using Canu v1.8: unitig read coverage 34.5X on genome size estimate (650Mb). The GC content of the assembly was 39.6%. Repeat content covered 46.7% of the genome, predominantly of transposable elements without complete classification. Of the identified transposable elements (TE), DNA type TE were the most widespread at 4.65% total coverage.
