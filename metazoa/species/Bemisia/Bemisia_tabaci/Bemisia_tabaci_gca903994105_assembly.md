**Assembly**
------------------------
The *Bemisia tabaci* Asia II 5 genome was produced by the genomics consortium of the [African Cassava Whitefly Project](http://www.cassavawhitefly.org), funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (Grant Number OPP1058938). 

A field-collected colony (Salem, Tamil Nadu, India) was established, maintained and inbred (F5 generation) by [Prof Maruthi Gowda](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=5czCi6oAAAAJ&hl=en) at the quarantine insectary facilities of the [Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich, United Kingdom](https://www.nri.org/).

High-molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from a pooled sample of F5 inbred haploid male individuals (n=3000). PacBio Sequel library construction and sequencing (8 SMRT cells) was performed by the [Centre for Genomic Research, The University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/genomic-research/) (United Kingdom).

The current assembly of the *B. tabaci* Asia II 5 genome was generated by [Dr Lahcen Campbell](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=zZ14f3EAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, UK). The length of the *B. tabaci* Asia II 5 genome assembly was 616.1Mb, housed in 227 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 10.8Mb. The assembly was produced using Canu v1.8: unitig read coverage 36.7X on genome size estimate (650Mb). GC content of the assembly was 39.6%. Repeat content covered 38.2% of the genome, predominantly of transposable elements without complete classification. Of the identified transposable elements (TE), DNA type TE were the most widespread at 3.79% total coverage.
