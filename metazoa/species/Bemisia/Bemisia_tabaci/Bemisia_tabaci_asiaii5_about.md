***Bemisia tabaci* Asia II 5**
------------------------
Whiteflies of the *Bemisia tabaci* (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) species complex are phloem-feeding insects and plant-virus vectors, some of which are widely regarded to be amongst the worldâ€™s worst agricultural pests. Outbreaks of *B. tabaci* cause significant crop losses and contribute to global food insecurity.

The *B. tabaci* species found on cassava (*Manihot esculenta*) in southern India and Asia has the name, *Bemisia tabaci* Asia II 5 [1].  It is a separate species from those found on cassava in Africa, which include, for example, *B. tabaci* Sub-Saharan Africa 1-Subgroup 1.

Since 2016, cassava mosaic disease (CMD; *Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus*), has been devastating cassava production in countries of Southeast Asia. To date, populations of *B. tabaci* Asia II 1 have been associated with CMD-infected cassava in these regions [2], although the host-range of this species remains unclear. In South Asia and South India, however, *B. tabaci* Asia II 5 is a pest of cassava and transmits *Indian cassava mosaic virus* (ICMV) [3,4]. Transmission experiments have shown that co-adaptation has occurred between the sympatric mosaic-viruses and *B. tabaci* species [3], i.e., *B. tabaci* Asia II 5 transmits the ICMV significantly more efficiently that the mosaic viruses of African origin. 

The genome described here was generated from an Indian population of *B. tabaci* Asia II 5, that was inbred in the laboratory to reduce heterozygosity. 


**The *Bemisia tabaci* cryptic species complex**
------------------------

Members of the *B. tabaci* species complex cause plant damage by feeding on plant-phloem sap, inducing phytotoxic disorders, depositing honeydew on which sooty moulds develop and by vectoring > 300 plant-virus species in the genera *Begomovirus*, *Carlavirus*, *Crinivirus*, *Ipomovirus*, *Polerovirus* and *Torradovirus* [5,6]. Diseases caused by these viruses often spread rapidly with devastating yield losses of up to 100% [7]. 

*Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* currently represents a relatively large group (>44) of mostly unresolved cryptic species, as inferred from phylogenetic species delimitation studies [1,8]. These morphologically indistinguishable species differ from one another not only in their genetic relatedness, but also in various biological traits such as plant host-range breadth, fecundity, insecticide resistance, and plant-virus transmission efficiencies.

*Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* are distributed globally, from tropical to temperate climatic zones and across all continents (except Antarctica) [1]. Most cryptic species in this complex, as currently understood, are geographically restricted, but two of them are highly invasive globally i.e., *B. tabaci* Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1, also referred to as biotype B and *Bemisia argentifolii*) and *B. tabaci* Mediterranean (MED, also referred to as biotype Q) [1]. *Bemisia tabaci* *sensu lato* live predominantly on herbaceous plant hosts and have been recorded from an exceedingly broad range of host plants (>500 species) [9]. The documented host-plant range of most cryptic species within the complex remains largely incomplete.
