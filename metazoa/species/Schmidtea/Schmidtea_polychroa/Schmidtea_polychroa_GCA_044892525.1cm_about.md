**About *Schmidtea polychroa***
-------------------------

The genus Schmidtea comprises four species of freshwater planarians, predominantly found in
Europe, with some populations also present in north Africa, Asia and introduced in regions of
America [2, 10]. Schmidtea polychroa has a Europe-wide distribution
from the Iberian Peninsula [1, 14] and Italy to Southern
Sweden in the North [11]. It also occurs in north-Africa and has been introduced
into North-America [2].

The life cycle of S. polychroa features two distinct reproductive strategies, associated to
different biotypes or chromosomal races [3, 4, 5], and
distributed in a geographic pattern:

 *  Diploid (2n) sexual strains are mostly restricted to southern Europe including northern
and central Italy, Sardinia, some areas of Spain and France, the Check Republic and
Hungary [12,13]. Sexual populations maybe occurs isolated in southern Sweden [11].

 * Polyploid (3n and 4n) parthenogens are more broadly distributed across the range of the
species, and can coexist with sexual populations [12].

Sexual and parthenogenetic individuals are not genetically isolated and can interbreed
producing fertile egg capsules [3]. Remarkably, individuals from purely
parthenogenetic populations are capable of occasional sex reproduction [6] a
trait than can contribute to the success of polyploid strains in colonising central and northern
Europe [7]. The species is not fissiparous.

The S. polychroa strain (internal ID: GOE00227) was collected at 43.71249; 16.72605 near the
Village of Gala, Croatia.
