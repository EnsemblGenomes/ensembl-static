**About *Schmidtea mediterranea***
-------------------------

The genus Schmidtea comprises four species of freshwater planarians, predominantly found in
Europe, with some populations also present in north Africa, Asia and introduced in regions of
America [2, 11]. Among these, Schmidtea mediterranea is the most
extensively studied species and serves as a well-established model organism for research in
regeneration and stem cell biology [13, 7].

The life cycle of S. mediterranea features two distinct reproductive strategies observed in
geographically separated wild populations [10]:

 * Sexual reproduction: Diploid (2n = 8) sexually reproducing populations are found in the
eastern part of the range of the species, including Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and one
locality in Tunisia. Notably, a triploid (3n = 12) egg-laying population has been identified
in Sardinia [4].

 * Asexual reproduction by fission: Predominantly diploid (2n = 8) fissiparous forms are
located in two localities in Catalunya and the Balearic Islands. These individuals exhibit
a heteromorphic translocation between the first and third chromosomes, visible in
metaphase spreads, with only one chromosome of each homologous pair affected
[12, 1]. A triploid (3n = 12) asexual population has also been
reported in Menorca [12]. Today, the presence of S. mediterranea in
continental Europe is limited to a few artificial ponds at the "Viver dels Tres Pins" in the
mountain of Montjuïc, Barcelona [14]. The diploid laboratory strain
C4 originates from a nearby spring in Montjuïc.

This is an assembly of the sexual laboratory strain S2F2 of S. mediterranea originally collected
in Sardinia that was extensively inbred over 16 generations to a total of 18 inbreeding
generations total, including 2 rounds of regeneration-induced self-fertilization of the same
individual.
