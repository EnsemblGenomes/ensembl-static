**Annotation**
----------

Metazoa displaying genes imported from GenBank entry linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_045838265.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_045838265.1).

Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by ["Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences"](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/rink).

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [metazoa](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
