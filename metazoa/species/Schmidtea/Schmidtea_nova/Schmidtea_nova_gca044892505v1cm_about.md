**About *Schmidtea nova***
-------------------------
Platyhelminthes is a phylum of relatively simple bilaterian, 
unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates commonly called flatworms or 
flat worms. Being acoelomates, and having no specialised circulatory 
and respiratory organs, they are restricted to having flattened shapes 
that allow oxygen and nutrients to pass through their bodies by 
diffusion. The digestive cavity has only one opening for both 
ingestion and egestion ; as a result, the food can not be processed 
continuously.
