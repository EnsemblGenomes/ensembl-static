**About *Schmidtea nova***
-------------------------
The genus Schmidtea comprises four species of freshwater planarians, predominantly found in
Europe, with some populations also present in north Africa, Asia and introduced in regions of
America [2,4]. Schmidtea nova is a poorly studied species and has
only been morphologically desctibed very recently [4]. Schmidtea nova is
reported only from a few localities ranging from northern Italy in the south to Sweden in the
north, and eastward to Romania (see [4] for a summary). This broad yet sparse
distribution suggests that S. nova may be more widespread and abundant than suggested by
the current species records.

Little is known about the life cycle of Schmidtea nova. Observed populations reproduce through
the deposition of egg capsules. Its karyotype consists of a diploid chromosome number of 2n =
6, differing from the 2n = 8 characteristic of other Schmidtea species, including its sister
species Schmidtea lugubris. Interestingly, S. nova appears to induce a developmental response
in embryos of the frog species Rana temporaria, which it preys upon [5].

The S. nova strain (internal ID: GOE00023) was collected at 51,0717710 and 13,7421400 in
Dresden, Germany, on 2013-04-14
