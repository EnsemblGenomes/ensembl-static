Annotation
----------

The annotation of the *Pediculus humanus* genome is a collaboration
between VectorBase, JCVI and the University of Geneva. Automated
annotation pipelines were run at each centre and the resulting set of
predictions merged into a canonical set. A first round of manual
appraisal and editing was undertaken by JCVI to improve the quality of
the prediction set. The geneset presented here (PhumU2.4, February 2018)
represents the original set integrated with mitochondrial genes and
non-coding RNA genes from the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
