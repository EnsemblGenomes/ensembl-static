Annotation
----------

The protein-coding genes displayed in Ensembl Genomes are imported from
[JGI](http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Capca1/Capca1.home.html). Non-coding RNA
genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed. The IDs of genes, transcripts and
translations must be unique across species in Ensembl Genomes (to allow
cross-species comparisons), which means that the JGI IDs cannot be used
without slight modifications. The JGI transcript and protein IDs have
been given the prefixes 'CapteT' and 'CapteP', respectively. Genes
have been renamed to have the format 'CapteG*xxx*', where *xxx* is the
original JGI transcript ID; the original JGI gene ID is stored as a
cross-reference. Searching on the original JGI IDs will return the
expected result (and potentially results from other species).
