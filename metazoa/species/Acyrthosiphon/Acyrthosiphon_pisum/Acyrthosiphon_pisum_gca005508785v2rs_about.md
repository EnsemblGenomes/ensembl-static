**About *Acyrthosiphon pisum***
-------------------------
*(*Acyrthosiphon pisum*)*, commonly known as the pea aphid, is a 
sap-sucking insect in the family Aphididae. It feeds on several 
species of legumes worldwide, including forage crops, such as pea, 
clover, alfalfa, and broad bean, and ranks among the aphid species of 
major agronomical importance. The pea aphid is a model organism for 
biological study whose genome has been sequenced and annotated.

Aphids are common agricultural pests that feed on sap from the phloem
vessels of a wide range of host plants. The pea aphid 
*Acyrthosiphon pisum* has co-evolved with an obligate bacterial
symbiont (*Buchnera aphidicola*), which provides essential 
amino acids that are rare in phloem and would otherwise be missing 
from the aphids\' diet. The co-evolution of the aphid and Buchnera 
has led to extensive gene loss from the genome, including immunity 
related pathways, purine salvage and the urea cycle. At the same 
time over 2000 gene families are duplicated, including miRNA synthesis 
and sugar transport [1,2].
