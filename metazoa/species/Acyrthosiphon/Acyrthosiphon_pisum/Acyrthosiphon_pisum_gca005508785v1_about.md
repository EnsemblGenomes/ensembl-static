About *Acyrthosiphon pisum*
---------------------------

Aphids are common agricultural pests that feed on sap from the phloem
vessels of a wide range of host plants. The pea aphid *Acyrthosiphon
pisum* has co-evolved with an obligate bacterial symbiont (*Buchnera
aphidicola*), which provides essential amino acids that are rare in
phloem and would otherwise be missing from the aphids\' diet. The
co-evolution of the aphid and Buchnera has led to extensive gene loss
from the genome, including immunity related pathways, purine salvage and
the urea cycle. At the same time over 2000 gene families are duplicated,
including miRNA synthesis and sugar transport [1,2].
