About *Nasonia vitripennis*
---------------------------

The jewel wasp (*Nasonia vitripennis*), is an important model for parasitoid genomics. Female wasps inject
venom (which is ultimately fatal) into a host pupa and lay eggs on its
surface, beneath the wall of the puparium. After about 2 weeks the adult
wasps, having fed on the pupa, eat their way through the puparium, where
the females mate with the (flightless) males before dispersing.

Parasitoid wasps are of practical interest because there are a vast
number of species, and a correspondingly vast number of host species,
including many that are considered to be agricultural pests. The wasps
are thus a potential biological alternative to chemical insecticides;
*N. vitripennis* is a generalist with respect to host species,
parasitizing a range of blowflies and houseflies. The *Nasonia* species
are interfertile and are amenable to study in a laboratory, and their
haplodiploid sex-determination reduces the complexity of genetic studies
\[2\]. Combined with the genome data, these factors permit the
investigation of a wide range of evolutionary topics, including
speciation, development\[3\], and host-parasite dynamics.
