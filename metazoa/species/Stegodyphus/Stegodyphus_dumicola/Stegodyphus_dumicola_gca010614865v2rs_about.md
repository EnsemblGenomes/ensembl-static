**About *Stegodyphus dumicola***
-------------------------
*Stegodyphus dumicola*, commonly known as the African social spider, 
is a species of spider of the family Eresidae or the velvet spider 
family. It is native to Central and southern Africa. This spider is 
one of three Stegodyphus spiders that lives a social lifestyle. This 
spider has been studied living in large natal colonies in large, 
unkempt webs. Each colony is composed mainly of females, where a 
minority act as reproducers, and a majority remain females and take 
care of the young. Males live a shorter lifespan and will largely 
remain in the natal nest throughout its life. Females are known for 
extreme allomaternal care, since all females, even unmated virgin 
females will take care of the young until they are eventually consumed 
by the brood.
