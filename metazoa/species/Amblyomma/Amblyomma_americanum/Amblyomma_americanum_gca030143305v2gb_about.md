**About *Amblyomma americanum***
-------------------------
*Amblyomma americanum*, also known as the lone star tick, the 
northeastern water tick, or the turkey tick, is a type of tick 
indigenous to much of the eastern United States and Mexico, that bites 
painlessly and commonly goes unnoticed, remaining attached to its host 
for as long as seven days until it is fully engorged with blood. It is 
a member of the phylum Arthropoda, class Arachnida. The adult lone 
star tick is sexually dimorphic, named for a silvery-white, 
star-shaped spot or "lone star" present near the center of the 
posterior portion of the adult female shield (scutum); adult males 
conversely have varied white streaks or spots around the margins of 
their shields.
