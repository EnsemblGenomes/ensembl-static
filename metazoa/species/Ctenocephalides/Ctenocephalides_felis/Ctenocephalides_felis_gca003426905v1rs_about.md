**About *Ctenocephalides felis***
-------------------------
The cat flea (*Ctenocephalides felis*) is an extremely common 
parasitic insect whose principal host is the domestic cat, although a 
high proportion of the fleas found on dogs also belong to this 
species. This is despite the widespread existence of a separate and 
well-established "dog" flea, Ctenocephalides canis. Cat fleas 
originated in Africa but can now be found globally. As humans began 
domesticating cats, the prevalence of the cat flea increased and it 
spread throughout the world.
