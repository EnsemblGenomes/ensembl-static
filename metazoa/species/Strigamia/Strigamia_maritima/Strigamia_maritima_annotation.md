Annotation
----------

Gene models were generated with the MAKER pipeline; resources for MAKER
included RNA-seq data (via the Cufflinks pipeline), similarity search
with metazoan protein databases, and the *ab initio* gene predictors
SNAP and Augustus. Non-coding RNA genes were added with the standard
[Ensembl Genomes RNA
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html); BLAST hits,
protein features, and cross-references have also been computed.
