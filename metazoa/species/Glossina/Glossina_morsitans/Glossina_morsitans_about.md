About *Glossina morsitans*
--------------------------

Male and female *tsetse* flies are the vectors
of the *trypanosomes* that cause African sleeping sickness in humans and
nagana in animals. It is conservatively estimated by the World Health
Organization that there are currently between 300,000 and 500,000 cases
of African sleeping sickness, with 60 million people at risk in 37
countries covering 40% of Africa. After a devastating epidemic in the
early 20th century, when a million people died of sleeping sickness, the
disease almost disappeared from Africa by the 1960s. However, we are now
in the midst of another epidemic, with increasing numbers of new
infections and mortality (55,000 deaths in 1993; 66,000 in 1999), and a
disease burden of 2.05 million disability adjusted life years (DALY).

*Glossina morsitans* distribution is not accurately known in all
countries. The subspecies *G. morsitans* submorsitans extends as a very
large but broken belt throughout West Africa, into southern Sudan,
northern Uganda and Ethiopia. Very large belts of *G. morsitans*
centralis occur in Zaire, Zambia, Angola, Botswana, Tanzania, Rwanda and
Burundi; belts of *G*. *morsitans morsitans* occur in Tanzania,
Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi. The boundary separating the two
subspecies *G. morsitans centralis* and *G. morsitans morsitans*
corresponds roughly with the Atlantic/Indian Ocean watershed.

*Yale* strain
-------------

The *Glossina morsitans* *Yale* strain comes from a colony hosted at the
[Yale School of Public
Health](http://publichealth.yale.edu/index.aspx "http://publichealth.yale.edu/index.aspx"),
in the [Aksoy
lab](http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/aksoy/ "http://medicine.yale.edu/labs/aksoy/").
