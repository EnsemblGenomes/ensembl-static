**About *Pogonomyrmex barbatus***
-------------------------
*Pogonomyrmex barbatus* is a species of harvester ant from the genus 
Pogonomyrmex. Its common names include red ant and red harvester ant 
(*Pogonomyrmex barbatus*). These large ants prefer arid chaparral 
habitats and are native to the Southwestern United States. Nests are 
made underground in exposed areas. Their diets consist primarily of 
seeds, and they consequently participate in myrmecochory, an ant-plant 
interaction through which the ants gain nutrients and the plants 
benefit through seed dispersal. Red harvester ants are often mistaken 
for fire ants, but are not closely related to any fire ant species, 
native or introduced.
