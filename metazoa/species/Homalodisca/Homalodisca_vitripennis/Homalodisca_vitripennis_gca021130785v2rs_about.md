**About *Homalodisca vitripennis***
-------------------------
The glassy-winged sharpshooter (*Homalodisca vitripennis*) is a large 
leafhopper, similar to other species of sharpshooter.They have piercing, 
sucking mouthparts and rows of fine spines on their hind legs.

It is native to North America (northeastern Mexico), but it was accidentally 
introduced into Southern California in the early 1990s, probably with ornamental 
or agricultural stock. There it has become an agricultural pest especially 
to viticulture.

The glassy-winged sharpshooter feeds on a wide variety of plants. Scientists 
estimate the host plants for this sharpshooter include over 70 different plant 
species. Among the hosts are grapes, citrus trees, almonds, stone fruit, 
and oleanders. Because of the large number of hosts, glassy-winged sharpshooter 
populations are able to flourish in both agricultural and urban areas. They 
feed on a plant by inserting their needle-like mouth parts into the plant's 
xylem.
