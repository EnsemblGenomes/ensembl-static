Ensembl Metazoa displaying genes linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_914767935.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_914767935.1).

Genomic assembly deposited to the INSDC by [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/). Genome annotation performed by Ensembl as part of the
partnership with the [Darwin Tree of Life (DToL)](https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) project.

Genome annotation was obtained using re-engineered versions of our Gene Annotation System [Aken *et al.*](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27337980) with
refinements implemented for [non-vertebrate genomic annotation](https://rapid.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/anno.html).
