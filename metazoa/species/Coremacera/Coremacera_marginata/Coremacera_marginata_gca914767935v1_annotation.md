**Annotation**
----------

[Protein-coding](https://rapid.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/anno.html) genes are automatically annotated using 
[Ensembl's genebuild pipeline.](https://rapid.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/full_genebuild.html)

All transcripts are based on mRNA and proteins in public scientific databases.

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [Ensembl Metazoa](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
