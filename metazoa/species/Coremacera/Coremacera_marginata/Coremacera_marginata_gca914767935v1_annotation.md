Ensembl Metazoa displaying genes linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_914767935.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_914767935.1).

Genomic assembly deposited to the INSDC by [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/). Genome annotation performed by Ensembl as part of the
partnership with the [Darwin Tree of Life (DToL)](https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/) project.

Genome annotation was obtained for protein-coding and non-coding RNA gene structures using re-engineered versions of our Gene Annotation 
System [Aken *et al.*](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27337980).
