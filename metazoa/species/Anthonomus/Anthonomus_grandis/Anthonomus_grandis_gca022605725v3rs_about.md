**About *Anthonomus grandis***
-------------------------

The boll weevil (*Anthonomus grandis grandis*) is a beetle that feeds on cotton buds and flowers. 
Thought to be native to Central Mexico, it migrated into the United States 
from Mexico in the late 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton-growing 
areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. 
During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. 
Since 1978, the Boll Weevil Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation 
to resume in many regions.
