**About *Homarus gammarus***
-------------------------
*Homarus gammarus*, known as the European lobster (*Homarus gammarus*) 
or common lobster, is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern 
Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea. It is 
closely related to the American lobster, *H.americanus*. It may grow to 
a length of 60cm (24in) and a mass of 6 kilograms (13lb), and bears 
a conspicuous pair of claws. In life the lobsters are blue, only 
becoming "lobster red" on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer, 
producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year 
before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly 
esteemed food, and is widely caught using lobster pots, mostly around 
the British Isles.
