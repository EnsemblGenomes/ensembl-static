About *Hymenolepis microstoma*
------------------------------

*Hymenolepis microstoma* is a member of the Cyclophyllidea, which comprises the majority of tapeworms that are of medical importance. The cestode *Hymenolepis microstoma*, or rodent tapeworm, is an intestinal dwelling parasite of mice and rats which is used as a laboratory model organism. Adult worms live in the bile duct and small intestines, using beetles as intermediate hosts. *H. microstoma* is prevalent in rodents worldwide causing hymenolepiasis, but rarely infects humans. In humans, hymenolepiasis is caused by two other tapeworms, *Hymenolepis nana* (the dwarf tapeworm) and *Hymenolepis diminuta* (rat tapeworm). Heavy infections can cause weakness, headaches, anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

As a parasite that is using natural hosts that are themselves model organisms, *H. microstoma* has been used as a tapeworm research model. A lot of our understanding of the basic biology of tapeworms and hymenolepiasis in humans and other animals stems from work on this species.
