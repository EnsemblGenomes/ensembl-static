**About *Echinococcus granulosus***
-------------------------
*Echinococcus granulosus*, also called the hydatid worm, hyper 
tape-worm or dog tapeworm, is a cyclophyllid cestode that dwells in 
the small intestine of canids as an adult, but which has important 
intermediate hosts such as livestock and humans, where it causes 
cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease. The adult 
tapeworm ranges in length from 3 mm to 6 mm and has three proglottids 
("segments") when intact—an immature proglottid, mature proglottid and 
a gravid proglottid. The average number of eggs per gravid proglottid 
is 823. Like all cyclophyllideans, E. granulosus has four suckers on 
its scolex ("head"), and E. granulosus also has a rostellum with 
hooks. Several strains of E. granulosus have been identified, and all 
but two are noted to be infective in humans.
