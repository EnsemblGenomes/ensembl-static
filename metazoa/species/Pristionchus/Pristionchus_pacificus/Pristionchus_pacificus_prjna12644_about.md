About *Pristionchus pacificus*
------------------------------

*Pristionchus pacificus* is a small, free-living roundworm, which is found on several continents and is associated with scarab beetles and Colorado potato beetles. It is part of the diplogastrids and it is estimated to have diverged from *C. elegans* 200-300 million years. It, therefore, shares many experimental advantages with C. elegans and is being used as a model organism for developmental biology and ecological studies, particularly in studies involving the analysis of vulval formation.
