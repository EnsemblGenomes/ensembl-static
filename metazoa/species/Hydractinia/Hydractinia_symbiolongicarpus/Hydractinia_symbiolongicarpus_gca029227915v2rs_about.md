**About *Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus***
-------------------------
*Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus* is one of the 30 + Hydractinia species 
known worldwide. This saltwater animal, from here on referred to as 
Hydractinia, is at the base of the Cnidaria phylum and in many ways, 
is similar to the freshwater Hydra. In the wild, Hydractinia feed on 
smaller invertebrates found in the shallow mud, however in laboratory 
environments they are fed brine shrimp. Hydractinia symbiolongicurpus 
and its sibling species, Hydractinia echinata, are the two species 
from the genus Hydractinia on which most work has been published.
