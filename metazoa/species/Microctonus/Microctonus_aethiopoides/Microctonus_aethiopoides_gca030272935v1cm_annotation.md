Ensembl Metazoa displaying genes imported from GenBank entry linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_030272935.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_030272935.1).

Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by [University of Otago](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCA_030272935.1/).

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [Ensembl Metazoa](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
