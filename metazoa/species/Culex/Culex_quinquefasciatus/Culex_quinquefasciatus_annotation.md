Annotation
----------

The annotation of the *C. quinquefasciatus* genome is a collaboration
between VectorBase, JCVI and the Broad Institute. Each group generated a
set of gene predictions which were merged into a single canonical set
\[1\]. The gene set currently shown (CpipJ2.4, October 2017) is an
improved version of the initial set, with integration of community
manual annotations and non-coding RNA genes from the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
