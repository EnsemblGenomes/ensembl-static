**About *Spodoptera frugiperda***
-------------------------
The fall armyworm (*Spodoptera frugiperda*) is a species in the order 
Lepidoptera and one of the species of the fall armyworm moths 
distinguished by their larval life stage. The term "armyworm" can 
refer to several species, often describing the large-scale invasive 
behavior of the species' larval stage. It is regarded as a pest and 
can damage and destroy a wide variety of crops, which causes large 
economic damage. Its scientific name derives from frugiperda, which is 
Latin for lost fruit, named because of the species' ability to destroy 
crops. Because of its propensity for destruction, the fall armyworm's 
habits and possibilities for crop protection have been studied in 
depth. It is also a notable case for studying sympatric speciation, as 
it appears to be diverging into two species currently. Another 
remarkable trait of the larva is that they consistently practice 
cannibalism, despite its fitness costs.
