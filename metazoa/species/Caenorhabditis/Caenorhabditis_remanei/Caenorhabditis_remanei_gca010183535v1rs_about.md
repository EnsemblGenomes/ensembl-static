**About *Caenorhabditis remanei***
-------------------------

*Caenorhabditis remanei* is a small, free-living roundworm found in decaying plant
material especially compost, mushroom beds in Northern temperate
regions. The worms feed on the bacteria and other micro-organisms
associated with plant decay. The biology of *C. remanei* is similar to
that of [*C. elegans*](/Caenorhabditis_elegans), with a short generation
time through four larval stages into an adult. *C.remanei* has both male
and female adults unlike the hermaphroditic species such as *C. elegans*
and *C. briggsae*. All three species are often found at the same site.
*C. remanei* is frequently found associated with snails, slugs,
millipedes, mites and pill bugs, which are presumed to transport worms,
especially the dormant dauer stage, from one location to another, as
with other Caenorhabditids.

*C. remanei* was known as *C. vulgaris* prior to the demonstration that
this was a junior synonym of *C. remanei* in 1996 (Sudhaus & Kiontke,
2006). The sequenced strain PB4641 was derived from a wild isolate EM464
isolated from a pillbug (*Armadillidium vulgare*) in Brooklyn, New York
in 1990. The wild isolate was inbred for 20 generations in the lab of
Scott Baird by transferral of a single gravid female per generation.
