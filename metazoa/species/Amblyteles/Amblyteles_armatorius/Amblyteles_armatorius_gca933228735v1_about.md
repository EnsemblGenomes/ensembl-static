**About *Amblyteles armatorius ***
-------------------------

*Amblyteles armatorius* is a species of parasitic wasp in the family
Ichneumonidae first described by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1771 [2].

*Amblyteles armatorius* can reach a length of 12â€“16 mm, excluding
antennae, which reach about 9 millimetres (0.35 in). The head and thorax
of this large wasp are black, except the yellow scutellum. The abdomen
is yellow and more oval in the females, with broad black bands. Legs are
yellow, except the hind legs, that are black and yellow. This species
lacks a sting, so the characteristic markings of many aculeate wasps
represent a protective mimicry.[1] The female has a very short
ovipositor that doesn't protrude from the abdomen.[2]

This species is a Palearctic species that is present in most of
Europe, in the Near East, and in the Oriental realm. These wasps
usually occur in hedgerows, meadows and spruce forest edges.
