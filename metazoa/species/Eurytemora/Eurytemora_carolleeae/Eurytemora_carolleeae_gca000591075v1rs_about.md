**About *Eurytemora carolleeae***
-------------------------
Crustaceans are invertebrate animals that constitute one group of 
arthropods that are a part of the subphylum Crustacea, a large, 
diverse group of mainly aquatic arthropods including decapods, seed 
shrimp, branchiopods, fish lice, krill, remipedes, isopods, barnacles, 
copepods, opossum shrimps, amphipods and mantis shrimp. The crustacean 
group can be treated as a subphylum under the clade Mandibulata. It is 
now well accepted that the hexapods emerged deep in the Crustacean 
group, with the completed pan-group referred to as Pancrustacea. The 
three classes Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda and Remipedia are more 
closely related to the hexapods than they are to any of the other 
crustaceans.
