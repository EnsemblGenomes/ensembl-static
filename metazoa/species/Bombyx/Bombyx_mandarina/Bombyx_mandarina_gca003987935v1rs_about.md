**About *Bombyx mandarina***
-------------------------
*Bombyx mandarina*, the wild silk moth, is an insect from the moth 
family Bombycidae. It is the closest relative of Bombyx mori, the 
domesticated silk moth. The silkworm is the larva or caterpillar of a 
silk moth. Unlike the domesticated relative which is unable to fly or 
indeed persist outside human care, the wild silk moth is a fairly 
ordinary lepidopteran. Its main difference from the domesticated taxon 
is the more slender body with well-developed wings in males, and the 
dull greyish-brown colour.
