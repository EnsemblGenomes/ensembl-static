**About *Bombyx mori***
-------------------------
*Bombyx mori*, commonly known as the domestic silk moth, is a moth 
species belonging to the family Bombycidae. It is the closest relative 
of Bombyx mandarina, the wild silk moth. Silkworms are the larvae of 
silk moths. The silkworm is of particular economic value, being a 
primary producer of silk. The silkworm's preferred food are the leaves 
of white mulberry, though they may eat other species of mulberry, and 
even leaves of other plants like the osage orange. Domestic silk moths 
are entirely dependent on humans for reproduction, as a result of 
millennia of selective breeding. Wild silk moths, which are other 
species of Bombyx, are not as commercially viable in the production of 
silk.
