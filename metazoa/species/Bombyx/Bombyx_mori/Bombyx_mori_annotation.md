Annotation
----------

Aggregation of *ab intio* and similarity based gene predictions was
achieved using a [GLEAN](http://glean-gene.sourceforge.net)-like
algorithm resulting in over 14,000 gene models. The annotations
displayed in Ensembl Metazoa are imported from
[SilkDB](http://silkworm.genomics.org.cn) \[5\]. Changes to the
scaffolds in release 22 of Ensembl Metazoa (see Assembly section)
resulted in some genes mapping to new positions; in all but two cases
the DNA sequence is unchanged. The exceptions are BGIBMGA009343, which
lost 8 exons that were on a duplicated region, and BGIBMGA014289 which
is truncated because part of the gene was on a contig believed to be a
bacterial contaminant. Non-coding RNA genes were added using the
[Ensembl Genomes pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html),
and BLAST hits and protein features have been computed.
