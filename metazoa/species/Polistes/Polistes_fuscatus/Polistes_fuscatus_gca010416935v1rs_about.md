**About *Polistes fuscatus***
-------------------------
*Polistes fuscatus*, whose common name is the dark or northern paper 
wasp, is widely found in eastern North America, from southern Canada 
through the southern United States. It often nests around human 
development. However, it greatly prefers areas in which wood is 
readily available for use as nest material, therefore they are also 
found near and in woodlands and savannas. P. fuscatus is a social wasp 
that is part of a complex society based around a single dominant 
foundress along with other cofoundresses and a dominance hierarchy.
