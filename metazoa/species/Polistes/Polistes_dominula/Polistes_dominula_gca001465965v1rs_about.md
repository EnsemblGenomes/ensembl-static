**About *Polistes dominula***
-------------------------
The European paper wasp (*Polistes dominula*) is one of the most 
common and well-known species of social wasps in the genus Polistes. 
Its diet is more diverse than those of most Polistes species—many 
genera of insects versus mainly caterpillars in other Polistes—giving 
it superior survivability compared to other wasp species during a 
shortage of resources.
