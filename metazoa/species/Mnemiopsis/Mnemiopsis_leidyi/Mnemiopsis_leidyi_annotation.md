Annotation
----------

Gene models were predicted using *ab initio* and homology-based methods
(FGENESH, AUGUSTUS HMMgene, GenomeScan, PASA, BLASTP results) which were
combined using [EVidenceModeler
(EVM)](http://evidencemodeler.sourceforge.net/) into a consensus gene
set. Non-coding RNA genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed. Additional data is available at the
NHGRI [Mnemiopsis Genome Project
Portal](http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/mnemiopsis/).
