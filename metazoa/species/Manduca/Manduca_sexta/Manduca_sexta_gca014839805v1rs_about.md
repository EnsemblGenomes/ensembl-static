**About *Manduca sexta***
-------------------------

*Manduca sexta* is a moth of the family Sphingidae present through
much of the Americas. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus
in his 1763 Centuria Insectorum.Commonly known as the Carolina sphinx 
moth and the tobacco hawk moth (as adults) and the tobacco hornworm 
and the Goliath worm (as larvae), it is closely related to and often confused 
with the very similar tomato hornworm (*Manduca quinquemaculata*); 
the larvae of both feed on the foliage of various plants of the family Solanaceae. 
Tobacco hornworms are facultative specialists; the larvae can grow 
and develop on any host plants. However, the larvae prefer solanaceous 
plants, such as tobacco and tomato plants.

*M. sexta* has a short life cycle, lasting about 30 to 50 days. 
In most areas, M. sexta has about two generations per year
*M. sexta* is a common model organism, especially in neurobiology, 
due to its easily accessible nervous system and short life cycle.
