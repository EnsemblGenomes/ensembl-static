**About *Platynereis dumerilii* **
-------------------------
*Platynereis dumerilii* is a species of annelid polychaete worm. It 
was originally placed into the genus Nereis and later reassigned to 
the genus Platynereis. Platynereis dumerilii lives in coastal marine 
waters from temperate to tropical zones. It can be found in a wide 
range from the Azores, the Mediterranean, in the North Sea, the 
English Channel, and the Atlantic down to the Cape of Good Hope, in 
the Black Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Sea of Japan, the 
Pacific, and the Kerguelen Islands. Platynereis dumerilii is today an 
important lab animal, it is considered a living fossil, and it is used 
in many phylogenetic studies as a model organism.
