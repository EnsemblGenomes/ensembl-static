**Annotation**
----------

Annotation of the EMBL\_pdum\_1.0 assembly was carried out by ["The Platynereis Community"](https://platynereis.com/resources/community/)
at the [EMBL Developmental Biology unit](https://www.embl.org/research/units/developmental-biology/).

The set
of gene models presented (genebuild EMBLpdum1v0.0, released September 2024)
are provided by the research community.

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [metazoa](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
