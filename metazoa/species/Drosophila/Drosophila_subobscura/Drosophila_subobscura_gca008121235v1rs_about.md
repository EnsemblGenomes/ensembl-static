**About *Drosophila subobscura***
-------------------------
*Drosophila subobscura* is a species of fruit fly in the family 
Drosophilidae. Originally found around the Mediterranean, it has 
spread to most of Europe and the Near East. It has been introduced 
into the west coasts of Canada, the United States, and Chile. Its 
closest relative is Drosophila madeirensis, found in the Madeira 
Islands, followed by D. guanche, found in the Canary Islands. These 
three species form the D. subobscura species subgroup. When they mate, 
males and females perform an elaborate courtship dance, in which the 
female can either turn away to end the mating ritual, or stick out her 
proboscis in response to the male's, allowing copulation to proceed. 
D. subobscura has been regarded as a model organism for its use in 
evolutionary-biological studies.
