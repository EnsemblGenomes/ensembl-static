Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes, which were annotated with the [NCBI
eukaryotic genome annotation
pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/),
were imported from [FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release
dyak\_r1.05 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 254,353 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 11 Mb (6.6% of the
genome); 70,827 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 31 Mb (19.0% of the genome); 122,416 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 9 Mb (5.5% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
