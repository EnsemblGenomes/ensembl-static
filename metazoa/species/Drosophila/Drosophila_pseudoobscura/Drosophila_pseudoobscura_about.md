About *Drosophila pseudoobscura*
--------------------------------

*Drosophila pseudoobscura* is a North American fruitfly that has been
used extensively in genetic studies, particularly with respect to
speciation. It was the second fruitfly to have its genome sequenced
\[1\], and was one of 12 fruitfly genomes included in a large
comparative study \[2\]. Ensembl Genomes imports data from
[FlyBase](https://flybase.org/), who also have much more information about
the [biology of *Drosophila
pseudoobscura*](https://fb2017_05.flybase.org/reports/FBsp00000201.html), and a
