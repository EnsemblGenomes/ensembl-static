Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes, which were annotated with the [NCBI
eukaryotic genome annotation
pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/),
were imported from [FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release
dpse\_r3.04 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 286,881 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 13 Mb (8.8% of the
genome); 25,800 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 10 Mb (6.7% of the genome); 181,856 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 12 Mb (7.7% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
