**About *Drosophila innubila***
-------------------------
*Drosophila innubila* is a species of vinegar fly restricted to 
high-elevation woodlands in the mountains of the southern USA and 
Mexico, which it likely colonized during the last glacial period. 
Drosophila innubila is a kind of mushroom-breeding Drosophila, and 
member of the Drosophila quinaria species group. Drosophila innubila 
is best known for its association with a strain of male-killing 
Wolbachia bacteria. These bacteria are parasitic, as they drain 
resources from the host and cause half the infected female's eggs to 
abort. However Wolbachia may offer benefits to the fly's fitness in 
certain circumstances. The D. innubila genome was sequenced in 2019.
