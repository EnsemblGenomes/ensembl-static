**About *Drosophila hydei***
-------------------------
*Drosophila hydei* (mosca casera) is a species of Diptera, or the 
order of flies, in the family Drosophilidae. It is a species in the 
hydei species subgroup, a group in the repleta species group. 
Bizarrely, it is also known for having approximately 23ï¿½mm long sperm, 
10 times the length of the male's body. Drosophila hydei are commonly 
found on compost piles worldwide, and can be rudimentarily identified 
by eye owing to their large size and variegated pigment pattern on the 
thorax. The name derives from Dr R. R. Hyde, who first discovered that 
the species was distinct from Drosophila repleta. D. hydei are one of 
the more popular flies used as feeders in the pet trade. A few 
varieties are available, some flightless. They are very similar to 
Drosophila melanogaster, despite having separated 50 million years 
ago.
