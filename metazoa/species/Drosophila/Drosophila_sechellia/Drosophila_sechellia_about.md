About *Drosophila sechellia*
----------------------------

*Drosophila sechellia* is endemic to (some of) the Seychelles, and was
one of 12 fruitfly genomes sequenced for a large comparative study
\[1\]. *D. sechellia* is useful for research into speciation because
mating with [*D. simulans*](/Drosophila_simulans/Info) produces fertile
females and sterile males \[2\]. Ensembl Genomes imports data from
[FlyBase](https://flybase.org/), who also have much more information about
the [biology of *Drosophila
sechellia*](https://fb2017_05.flybase.org/reports/FBsp00000217.html), and a
