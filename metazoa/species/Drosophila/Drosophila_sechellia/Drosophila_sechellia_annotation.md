Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes were imported from
[FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release dsec\_r1.3 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 227,452 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 18 Mb (10.6% of
the genome); 59,336 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 28 Mb (16.8% of the genome); 77,058 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 15 Mb (9.1% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
