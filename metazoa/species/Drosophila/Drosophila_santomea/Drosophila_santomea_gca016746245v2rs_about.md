**About *Drosophila santomea***
-------------------------

*Drosophila santomea* is the first *melanogaster* sibling found off West-equatorial Africa, on Sao Tome, one of the Gulf of Guinea islands [1].
*D. santomea* is the first insular *melanogaster* sibling found in the eastern Equatorial Atlantic Ocean and the first insular endemic not 
belonging to the simulans clade [1].

*Drosophila* is a genus of flies, belonging to the family *Drosophilidae*, whose members are often called "small fruit flies" or pomace flies, 
vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be 
confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies; tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many 
species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly.
