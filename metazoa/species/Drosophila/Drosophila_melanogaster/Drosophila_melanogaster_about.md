About *Drosophila melanogaster*
-------------------------------

*Drosophila melanogaster* is a cosmopolitan species of fruitfly that has
been used as a model organism for over a hundred years, particularly
with respect to genetics and developmental biology. It was the second
metazoan (the first being [Caenorhabditis
elegans](/Caenorhabditis_elegans/Info/Index)) to have its genome
sequenced \[1\], and was one of 12 fruitfly genomes included in a large
comparative study \[2\]. Ensembl Genomes imports data from
[FlyBase](https://flybase.org), who also have much more information about
the [biology of *Drosophila
melanogaster*](https://fb2017_05.flybase.org/reports/FBsp00000001.html),
and a [phylogeny of the 12 sequenced fruitfly
