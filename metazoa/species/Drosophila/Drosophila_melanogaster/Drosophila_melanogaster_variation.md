Variation
---------

The Ensembl Metazoa *Drosophila melanogaster* variation database has
been produced using data from [release
1.0](http://www.dpgp.org/1K_50genomes.html#Reference_Release_1.0) of the
\"50 genomes\" data set from the [Drosophila Population Genome
Project](http://www.dpgp.org). The data set contains over 6.7 million
SNPs from two populations, one comprising 37 lines from north Carolina
and the other comprising 15 lines from Malawi. The SNPs were originally
generated with respect to assembly version BDGP5, and these were mapped
to BDGP6 using the [FlyBase converter
tool](https://flybase.org//static_pages/downloads/COORD.html); only 308
SNPs were unable to be mapped.
