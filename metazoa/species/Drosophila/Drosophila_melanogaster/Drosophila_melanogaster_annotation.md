Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes were imported from
[FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release dmel\_r6.54 (FB2023\_05).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 222,250 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 8 Mb (5.5% of the
genome); 48,594 RepeatMasker features (with a custom library), covering
28 Mb (19.5% of the genome); 1425 RepeatMasker features (with the
RepBase library), covering 0 Mb (0.1% of the genome); 72,624 Tandem
repeats (TRF) features, covering 6 Mb (4.1% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
