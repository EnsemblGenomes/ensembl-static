**About *Drosophila miranda***
-------------------------

*Drosophila miranda*, a close relative of *D. pseudoobscura*, has a recently formed new sex chromosome pair (called the neo-sex chromosomes). 
The Neo-Y chromosome is believed to be in  transition from an ordinary autosome into a degenerate Y chromosome [1].

*Drosophila* is a genus of flies, belonging to the family *Drosophilidae*, whose members are often called "small fruit flies" or pomace flies, 
vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be 
confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies; tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many 
species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly.
