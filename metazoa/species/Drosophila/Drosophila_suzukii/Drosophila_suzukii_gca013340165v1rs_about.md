**About *Drosophila suzukii***
-------------------------

*Drosophila suzukii*, commonly called the spotted wing drosophila or 
SWD, is a fruit fly. D. suzukii, originally from southeast Asia, is 
becoming a major pest species in America and Europe, because it 
infests fruit early during the ripening stage, in contrast with other 
Drosophila species that infest only rotting fruit.
