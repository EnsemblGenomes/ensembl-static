**About *Drosophila albomicans***
-------------------------

*Drosophila albomicans* is a species of vinegar fly in the family 
Drosophilidae. Drosophila albomicans is a member of the 
Immigrans-tripunctata radiation of the subgenus Drosophila. The D. 
albomicans genome was first sequenced in 2012 to study the evolution 
of novel sex chromosomes, a characteristic this species is best known 
for. One commonly accepted definition of the biological species 
concept is that individuals or populations are members of different 
species if they are incapable of successful interbreeding. While D. 
albomicans and Drosophila nasuta are commonly referred to as distinct 
species, there appears to be little to no sexual isolation between 
these two Drosophila species. Instead, behavioural differences appear 
to reproductively isolate these two species.
