Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes, which were annotated with the [NCBI
eukaryotic genome annotation
pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/),
were imported from [FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release
dsim\_r2.02 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 180,460 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 6 Mb (4.6% of
the genome); 31,441 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 9 Mb (7.2% of the genome); 60,487 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 3 Mb (2.5% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
