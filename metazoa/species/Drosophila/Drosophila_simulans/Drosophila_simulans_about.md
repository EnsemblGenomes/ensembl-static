About *Drosophila simulans*
---------------------------

*Drosophila simulans* is, in evolutionary terms, closely related to [*D.
melanogaster*](/Drosophila_melanogaster/Info), and was one of 12
fruitfly genomes sequenced for a large comparative study \[1\]. In
addition to comparison with the exceptionally well-studied *D.
melanogaster*, *D. simulans* is useful for research into speciation due
to its close relationship with [*D.
sechellia*](/Drosophila_sechellia/Info) and *D. mauritiana* \[2\].
Ensembl Genomes imports data from [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/), who
also have much more information about the [biology of *Drosophila
simulans*](https://fb2017_05.flybase.org/reports/FBsp00000002.html), and a
