Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes, which were annotated with the [NCBI
eukaryotic genome annotation
pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/),
were imported from [FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release
dmoj\_r1.04 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 462,085 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 35 Mb (18.3% of
the genome); 74,982 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 24 Mb (12.3% of the genome); 303,230 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 25 Mb (12.8% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
