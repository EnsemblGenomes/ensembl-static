Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes were imported from
[FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release dper\_r1.3 (FB2017\_04).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 311,606 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 23 Mb (12.1% of
the genome); 67,484 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 37 Mb (19.8% of the genome); 191,184 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 12 Mb (6.3% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
