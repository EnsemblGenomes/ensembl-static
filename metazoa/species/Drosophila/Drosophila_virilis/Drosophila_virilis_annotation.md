Annotation
----------

Protein-coding and RNA genes, which were annotated with the [NCBI
eukaryotic genome annotation
pipeline](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/),
were imported from [FlyBase](https://www.flybase.org/), release
dvir\_r1.07 (FB2018\_05).

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). There
are: 400,856 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 39 Mb (18.7% of
the genome); 84,370 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library),
covering 33 Mb (16.2% of the genome); 207,929 Tandem repeats (TRF)
features, covering 32 Mb (15.7% of the genome).

Protein domains were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes protein feature
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/protein_features.html).
