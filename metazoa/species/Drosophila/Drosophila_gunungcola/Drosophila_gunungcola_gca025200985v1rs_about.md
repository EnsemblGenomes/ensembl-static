**About *Drosophila gunungcola***
-------------------------

*Drosophila gunungcola* is one of the five described species in the elegans species subgroup under the D. melanogaster species group of 
Sophophora subgenus in *Drosophila*. *Drosophila gunungcola* exhibits reproductive activities on the fresh flowers of several plant species 
and is an emerging model to study the co-option of morphological and behavioral traits in male courtship display [1].

*Drosophila* is a genus of flies, belonging to the family *Drosophilidae*, whose members are often called "small fruit flies" or pomace flies, 
vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be 
confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies; tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many 
species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly.
