**About *Drosophila navojoa***
-------------------------

*Drosophila navojoa* part of a triad of species that also includes its sister species, *D. mojavensisis* and *D. arizonae*, known as the *D.mojavensis* cluster [1]. 
Both *D. navojoa* and *D. arizonae* represent two species of cactophilic species, feeding and or living on cacti [1]. 

*Drosophila* is a genus of flies, belonging to the family *Drosophilidae*, whose members are often called "small fruit flies" or pomace flies, 
vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be 
confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies; tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many 
species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly.
