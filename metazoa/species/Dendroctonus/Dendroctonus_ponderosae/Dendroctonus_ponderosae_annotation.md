Annotation
----------

Genes were generated with MAKER, which used *ab initio* predictions
(from AUGUSTUS, Snap, and GeneMark), and alignments of EST sequences,
RNA-seq data, and *Tribolium castaneum* proteins. Protein-coding genes
are imported into Ensembl Genomes from the
[ENA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000355655) records that
were submitted by the same team responsible for the assembly \[1\].
Non-coding RNA genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed.
