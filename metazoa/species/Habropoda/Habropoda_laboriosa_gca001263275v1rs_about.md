**About *Habropoda laboriosa***
-------------------------
*Habropoda laboriosa*, the southeastern blueberry bee, is a bee in the 
family Apidae. It is native to the southeastern United States. It is 
regarded as the most efficient pollinator of southern rabbiteye 
blueberries, because the flowers require buzz pollination, and H. 
laboriosa is one of the few bees that exhibit this behavior. It is 
active for only a few weeks of the year, while the blueberries are in 
flower during early spring, when the temperature is warm and humid. H. 
laboriosa are solitary bees that live alone but nest in close 
proximity with other nests of their species. They have similar 
features to bumble bees, but they are smaller in size compared to 
them. H. laboriosa are arthropods so they have segmented bodies that 
are composed of the head, thorax, and abdomen.
