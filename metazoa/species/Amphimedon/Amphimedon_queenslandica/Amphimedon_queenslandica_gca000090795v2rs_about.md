**About *Amphimedon queenslandica***
-------------------------
*Amphimedon queenslandica* is a sponge native to the Great 
Barrier Reef. Its genome has been sequenced. It has been the subject 
of various studies on the evolution of metazoan development.

*Amphimedon queenslandica* (formerly *A. reniera*) is a sponge,
discovered in 1998 and formally described in 2006 \[1\]. Despite its
recent identification, this native of Great Barrier Reef has already
proved itself a useful subject for the study of the evolutionary origins
of metazoan development \[2,3\], and is the first member of phylum
Porifera to have had its genome sequenced.
