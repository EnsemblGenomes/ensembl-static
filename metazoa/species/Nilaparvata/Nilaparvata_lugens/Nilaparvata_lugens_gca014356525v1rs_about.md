**About *Nilaparvata lugens***
-------------------------
The brown planthopper (*Nilaparvata lugens*) (BPH), *Nilaparvata 
lugens* is a planthopper species that feeds on rice plants. 
These insects are among the most important pests of rice, which is the 
major staple crop for about half the world's population. They damage 
rice directly through feeding and also by transmitting two viruses, 
rice ragged stunt virus and rice grassy stunt virus. Up to 60% yield 
loss is common in susceptible rice cultivars attacked by the insect.

The BPH is distributed throughout Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma 
(Myanmar), Cambodia, China, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, North and 
South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, 
Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Their alternative host plant other than rice is Leersia hexandra.
