**About *Photinus pyralis***
-------------------------
*Photinus pyralis*, also known by the common names the common eastern 
firefly (*Photinus pyralis*) or big dipper firefly, and sometimes 
called a "lightning bug", is a species of flying beetle. An organ on 
its abdomen is responsible for its light production. It is the most 
common species of firefly in North America, and is typically found 
east of the Rocky Mountains. Photinus fireflies are often confused 
with fireflies of the similar-sounding genus, Photuris, which are also 
found in North America.
