**About *Thrips palmi***
-------------------------
*Thrips palmi* is an insect from the genus Thrips in the order 
Thysanoptera. It is known commonly as the melon thrips.

It is a primary vector of plant viruses. The melon thrips can cause 
damage to a wide range of glasshouse ornamental and vegetable crops, 
particularly plants in the families Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae, 
such as cucumber, aubergine, tomato and sweet pepper.[1]

Adults and nymphs feed by sucking the cell contents from leaves, 
stems, flowers and the surface of fruits, causing silvery scars and 
leaf chlorosis. Plants can be deformed and killed in heavy infestations. 
The pest almost certainly originated in Southeast Asia, but in recent 
decades it has been widely introduced and has been observed throughout 
Asia and the Pacific, Florida, the Caribbean, South America, Africa, 
and Australia.[1]
