**About *Limnephilus rhombicus ***
-------------------------

Limnephilus rhombicus is a species of northern caddisfly in the family Limnephilidae. 
It is found in Europe and northern Asia (excluding China).

Limnephilidae is a family of caddisflies with about 100 genera. They
belong to the main lineage of case-constructing caddisflies, the
Integripalpia or tube-case caddisflies. The Limnephilidae is one of the
most species-rich Trichoptera families of northern temperate regions,
but only a few are known from tropical areas and the Southern
Hemisphere. For this reason they are often known as northern
caddisflies.
