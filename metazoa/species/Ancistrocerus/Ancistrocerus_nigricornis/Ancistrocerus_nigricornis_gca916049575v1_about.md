**About *Ancistrocerus nigricornis ***
-------------------------

*Ancistrocerus nigricornis* is a species of potter wasp. Potter wasps
(or mason wasps), the Eumeninae, are a cosmopolitan wasp group presently
treated as a subfamily of Vespidae, but sometimes recognized in the past
as a separate family, Eumenidae.

Eumenine wasps are diverse in nest building. The different species may
either use existing cavities (such as beetle tunnels in wood, abandoned
nests of other Hymenoptera, or even man-made holes like old nail holes
and screw shafts on electronic devices) that they modify in several
degrees, or they construct their own either underground or exposed
nests.
