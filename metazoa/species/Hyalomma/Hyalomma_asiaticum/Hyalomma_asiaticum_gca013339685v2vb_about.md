**About *Hyalomma asiaticum***
-------------------------
Ticks are parasitic arachnids of the order Ixodida. They are part of 
the mite superorder Parasitiformes. Adult ticks are approximately 3 to 
5 mm in length depending on age, sex, species, and "fullness". Ticks 
are external parasites, living by feeding on the blood of mammals, 
birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. The timing of the origin 
of ticks is uncertain, though the oldest known tick fossils are from 
the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years old. Ticks are widely 
distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.
