The gene models were predicted [1] at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD Marine Biology Research Division using MAKER2 pipeline and deposited at [GeneBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_007210705.1) from where Ensembl Genomes imported the data. Non-coding RNA genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
