Assembly
--------

The *S. invicta* genome was assembled primarily with sequence data from
a haploid male ant, generated with Illumina and Roche 454 technologies.
Long insert libraries (8-kb and 20-kb) were used to complete the
assembly, using DNA from a pooled sample of the male ant\'s brothers
\[1\]. The updated version is [*Si_gnH*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000188075.2).
