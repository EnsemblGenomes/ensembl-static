**About *Halyomorpha halys***
-------------------------
The brown marmorated stink bug (*Halyomorpha halys*) is an insect in 
the family Pentatomidae, native to China, Japan, Korea, and other 
Asian regions. In September 1998, it was collected in Allentown, 
Pennsylvania, where it is believed to have been accidentally 
introduced. The nymphs and adults of the brown marmorated stink bug 
feed on over 100 species of plants, including many agricultural crops, 
and by 2010â€“11 had become a season-long pest in orchards in the 
Eastern United States. In 2010, in the Mid-Atlantic United States, $37 
million in apple crops were lost, and some stone fruit growers lost 
more than 90% of their crops. Since the 2010s, the bug has spread to 
the nation of Georgia and Turkey and caused extensive damage to 
hazelnut production. It is now established in many parts of North 
America, and has recently become established in Europe and South 
America.
