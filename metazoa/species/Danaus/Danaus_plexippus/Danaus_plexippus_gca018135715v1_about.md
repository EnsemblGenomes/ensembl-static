**About *Danaus plexippus***
-------------------------
The monarch butterfly (*Danaus plexippus*) or simply monarch is a 
milkweed butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. Other common names, 
depending on region, include milkweed, common tiger, wanderer, and 
black-veined brown. It is among the most familiar of North American 
butterflies and an iconic pollinator, although it is not an especially 
effective pollinator of milkweeds. Its wings feature an easily 
recognizable black, orange, and white pattern, with a wingspan of 
8.9–10.2 cm (3.5–4.0 in). A Müllerian mimic, the viceroy butterfly, is 
similar in color and pattern, but is markedly smaller and has an extra 
black stripe across each hindwing.
