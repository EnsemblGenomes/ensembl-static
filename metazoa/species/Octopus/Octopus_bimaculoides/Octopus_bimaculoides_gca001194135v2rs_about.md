**About *Octopus bimaculoides***
-------------------------
The California two-spot octopus (*Octopus bimaculoides*), often simply 
called a "bimac", is an octopus species native to many parts of the 
Pacific Ocean including the coast of California. One can identify the 
species by the circular blue eyespots on each side of its head. Bimacs 
usually live to be about two years old. They are closely related to 
Verrill's two-spot octopus. In 2015, the genome was sequenced.
