**About *Adelges cooleyi***
-------------------------
The gall adelgid is an adelgid species that produces galls in spruce 
trees. They infect the new buds of native spruce trees in the 
foothills of the Rocky Mountains in the spring. They also attack blue 
spruce to a lesser degree. The insects complete two generations within 
the year. They require two different trees for its life cycle, the 
second being the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. They may also attack 
Sitka, Engelmann, or white spruce. The many different species of 
adelgids produce different galls on different spruce species.
