**About *Lucilia sericata***
-------------------------
The common green bottle fly (*Lucilia sericata*) is a blowfly found in 
most areas of the world and is the most well-known of the numerous 
green bottle fly species. Its body is 10–14 mm (0.39–0.55 in) in 
length – slightly larger than a house fly – and has brilliant, 
metallic, blue-green or golden coloration with black markings. It has 
short, sparse, black bristles (setae) and three cross-grooves on the 
thorax. The wings are clear with light brown veins, and the legs and 
antennae are black. The larvae of the fly may be used for maggot 
therapy, are commonly used in forensic entomology, and can be the 
cause of myiasis in livestock and pets. The common green bottle fly 
emerges in the spring for mating.
