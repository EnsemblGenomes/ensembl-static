About *Lucilia cuprina*
-----------------------

The species ***Lucilia cuprina***, formerly named *Phaenicia cuprina*,
is more commonly known as the **Australian sheep blowfly**. It belongs
to the blow-fly family Calliphoridae, and while some authorities combine
the blow flies (Calliphoridae) and the flesh flies (Sarcophagidae)
together into the Metopiidae family, distinguishable characteristics
allow for the separation. Blow flies are about the size of a house fly
or a little larger, and though considered to be nuisances indoors are
essential agents in the breakdown of organic matter.

*Lucilia cuprina* causes the condition known as \'sheep strike\'. The
female fly locates a sheep with an open wound in which she lays her
eggs. The emerging larvae cause large lesions on the sheep, which may
prove to be fatal.
