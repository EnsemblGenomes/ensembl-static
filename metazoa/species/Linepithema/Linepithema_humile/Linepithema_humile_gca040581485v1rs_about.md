**About *Linepithema humile***
-------------------------
The Argentine ant (*Linepithema humile*) is an ant native to northern 
Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and southern Brazil. This 
invasive species was inadvertently introduced by humans on a global 
scale and has become established in many Mediterranean climate areas, 
including South Africa, New Zealand, Japan, Easter Island, Australia, 
the Azores, Europe, Hawaii, and the continental United States. 
Argentine ants are significant pests within agricultural and urban 
settings, and are documented to cause substantial harm to communities 
of native arthropods, vertebrates, and plants within their invaded 
range.
