Despite the great ecological relevance of the soil community, insight
into molecular processes underlying the ecology and evolution of soil
invertebrates is largely unknown. *Folsomia candida* is an accepted
international standard for soil quality assessment. An internationally
standardized soil toxicity test has been developed for this species and
further details can be obtained from the genome portal
([www.collembolomics.nl](http://www.collembolomics.nl)) at the
Department of Ecological Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
