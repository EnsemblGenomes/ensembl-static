Despite the great ecological relevance of the soil community, insight
into molecular processes underlying the ecology and evolution of soil
invertebrates is largely unknown. Collembola (springtails) are important
detritivorous hexapods that inhabit the soil and its litter layer.
*Orchesella cincta* is an obligate sexually reproducing species and
populations live in the soil litter layer feeding on decaying organic
material. *O. cincta* populations living in metal contaminated areas,
such as mining sites, have evolved tolerance to heavy metals.

Further details about *Orchesella cincta* can be obtained from the
genome portal ([www.collembolomics.nl](http://www.collembolomics.nl)) at
the Department of Ecological Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
