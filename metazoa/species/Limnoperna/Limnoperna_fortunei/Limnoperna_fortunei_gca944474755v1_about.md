**About *Limnoperna fortunei ***
-------------------------

*Limnoperna fortunei*, the golden mussel, is a medium-sized freshwater
bivalve mollusc of the family Mytilidae. The native range of the species
is China, but it has accidentally been introduced to South America and
several Asian countries where it has become an invasive species. It is
considered to be an ecosystem engineer because it alters the nature of
the water and the bottom habitats of lakes and rivers and modifies the
associated invertebrate communities. It also has strong effects on the
properties of the water column, modifying nutrient proportions and
concentrations, increasing water transparency, decreasing phytoplankton
and zooplankton densities, on which it feeds, and enhancing the growth
of aquatic macrophytes. Because mussels attach to hard substrata,
including the components of industrial, water-treatment and power
plants, they have become a major biofouling problem in the areas
invaded.

Limnoperna fortunei is dioecious, with approximately equal numbers of
males and females and very small proportions of hermaphrodites. *L. fortunei*
is a strictly freshwater species, although it can tolerate
brackish waters of up to 23 per mil (23 grams of salt per liter of
water) for restricted periods of time (hours).
