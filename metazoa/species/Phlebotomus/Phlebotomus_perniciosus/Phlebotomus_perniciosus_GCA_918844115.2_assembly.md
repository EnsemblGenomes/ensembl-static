**Assembly**
------------------------
The genome assembly presented here is linked to the assembly accession [[GCA\_918844115.2](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_918844115.2)]. This genome assembly was produced as part of the Infravec2 project "De novo genome for Infravec. A hematophagous fly Phlebotomus perniciosus, Murcia strain assembly." to study *P. perniciosus*. The assembly was produced using MegaHit v1.2.9 [3]. This material sampled from *P. perniciosus* strain 'Murcia', made available as biological resource for distribution via the Infravec product catalog (https://infravec2.eu/). The assembly 
produced from a single genomic gDNA Illumina PE library "SAMEA10651172" ([ERX6791865](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERX6791865)).

The total length of the assembly is 166001358 bp contained within 77886 scaffolds.
The scaffold N50 value is 14455, the scaffold L50 value is 2233.
Assembly gaps span 374089 bp. The GC% content of the assembly is 37.0%.

Draft quality and performance assessed with comparison to another sand fly (Phlebotomous); the *P. pappatasi* reference assembly **GCA_000262795.1**.
