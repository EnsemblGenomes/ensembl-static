**About *Plodia interpunctella***
-------------------------
The Indianmeal moth (*Plodia interpunctella*), also spelled Indian 
meal moth and Indian-meal moth, is a pyraloid moth of the family 
Pyralidae. Alternative common names are hanger-downers, weevil moth, 
pantry moth, flour moth or grain moth. The almond moth and the raisin 
moth are commonly confused with the Indian-meal moth due to similar 
food sources and appearance. The species was named for feeding on 
Indian meal or cornmeal, and does not occur natively in India. It is 
also not to be confused with the Mediterranean flour moth, another 
common pest of stored grains.
