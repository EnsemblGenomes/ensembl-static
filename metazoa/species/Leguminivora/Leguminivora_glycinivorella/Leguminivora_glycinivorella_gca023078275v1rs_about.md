-------------------------
Maruca is a genus of moths of the family Crambidae, commonly known as 
bean pod borers.

The Crambidae is the grass moth family of lepidopterans. They are variable in appearance, 
the nominal subfamily Crambinae taking up closely folded postures on grass stems where 
they are inconspicuous, while other subfamilies include brightly coloured and patterned 
insects which rest in wing-spread attitudes.Crambid larvae are typically stem borers 
in plants of the grass family. As this family contains many important crops,
some Crambidae species achieve pest status.
