**About *Aethina tumida***
-------------------------
The small hive beetle (*Aethina tumida*) is a beekeeping pest. It is 
native to sub-Saharan Africa, but has spread to many other locations, 
including North America, Australia, and the Philippines.

The small hive beetle can be a destructive pest of honey bee colonies,
causing damage to comb, stored honey, and pollen. If a beetle
infestation is sufficiently heavy, they may cause bees to abandon their
hive. Its presence can also be a marker in the diagnosis of colony
collapse disorder for honey bees. The beetles can also be a pest of
stored combs, and honey (in the comb) awaiting extraction. Beetle larvae
may tunnel through combs of honey, feeding and defecating, causing
discoloration and fermentation of the honey.
