About *Ixodes scapularis*
-------------------------

*Ixodes scapularis*, the black-legged tick, is a hard-bodied tick from
the Ixodidae family. *I. scapularis* is the primary vector for Lyme
disease, transmitting the pathogenic bacterium *Borrelia burgdorfei*.

*Wikkel strain*
---------------

The *Ixodes scapularis* Wikel colony was established by Dr. S. Wikel
(University of Connecticut Health Center) in 1996 using approximately 30
pairs of field collected adult male and female ticks from New York,
Oklahoma and a Lyme disease endemic area of Connecticut. The colony has
been continuously in-bred for approximatley twelve generations since
establishment and has not been supplemented with field collected
material. The colony is known to be a competent vector of various
*Borrelia burgdorferi* (strains B31 and 297) and *Babesia microti*
isolates. Dr. D. Sonenshine at Old Dominion University also maintains a
satellite colony of the Wikel strain.
