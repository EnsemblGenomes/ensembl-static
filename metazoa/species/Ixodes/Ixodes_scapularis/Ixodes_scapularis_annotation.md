Annotation
----------

The annotation of the Ixodes genome is a collaboration between
VectorBase and JCVI with support from the Broad Institute. Each group
generated a set of gene predictions which were merged into a single
canonical set (IscaW1.1). The gene set currenty shown (IscaW1.6, October
2017) is an improvement of the initial set, with the addition of
community annotation and non-coding RNA genes from the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
