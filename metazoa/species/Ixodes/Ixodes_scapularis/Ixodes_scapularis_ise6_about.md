About *Ixodes scapularis*
-------------------------

*Ixodes scapularis*, the black-legged tick, is a hard-bodied tick from
the Ixodidae family. *I. scapularis* is the primary vector for Lyme
disease, transmitting the pathogenic bacterium *Borrelia burgdorfei*.

*ISE6* cell line
----------------

The *ISE6* cell line (*Ixodes scapularis* embryonic 6) is an extensively
used tick cell line that has been successfully used to culture many
tick-associated bacteria (*Rickettsia*, *Anaplasma*, *Ehrlichia*, and
*Neoehrlichia*), to study vector-pathogen interactions and differential
expression of pathogen genes during growth in mammalian and arthropod
cells, to carry out growth and propagation of *Arboviruses*, and are an
important model for molecular study using RNAi of tick genes important
for decreasing pathogen transmission and understanding tick biology (
