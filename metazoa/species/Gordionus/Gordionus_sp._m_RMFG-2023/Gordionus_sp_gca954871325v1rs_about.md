**About *Gordionus sp. m RMFG-2023***
-------------------------
Nematomorpha are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially similar 
to nematode worms in morphology, hence the name. Most species range in 
size from 50 to 100 millimetres, reaching 2 metres (79 in) in extreme 
cases, and 1 to 3 millimetres in diameter. Horsehair worms can be 
discovered in damp areas, such as watering troughs, swimming pools, 
streams, puddles, and cisterns. The adult worms are free-living, but 
the larvae are parasitic on arthropods, such as beetles, cockroaches, 
mantises, orthopterans, and crustaceans. About 351 freshwater species 
are known and a conservative estimate suggests that there may be about 
2000 freshwater species worldwide. The name "Gordian" stems from the 
legendary Gordian knot. This relates to the fact that nematomorphs 
often coil themselves in tight balls that resemble knots.
