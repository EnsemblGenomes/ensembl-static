Annotation
----------

Gene models were predicted using *ab initio* and homology-based methods
(FGENESH, FGENESH+ and GENEWISE). Since release 22 (March 2014), Ensembl
Genomes has displayed the ENA gene set; this gene set is a subset of the
original JGI gene set, therefore all genes contain a JGI cross
reference. Between Ensembl Genomes release 21 and release 22, 203
protein-coding genes were removed, and 119 new pseudogenes were
imported. Non-coding RNA genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed. Additional data is available at
[StellaBase](http://nematostella.bu.edu/stellabase/) \[2\].
