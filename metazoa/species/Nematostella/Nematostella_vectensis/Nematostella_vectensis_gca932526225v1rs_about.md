**About *Nematostella vectensis***
-------------------------
The starlet sea anemone (*Nematostella vectensis*) is a species of 
small sea anemone in the family Edwardsiidae native to the east coast 
of the United States, with introduced populations along the coast of 
southeast England and the west coast of the United States. Populations 
have also been located in Nova Scotia, Canada. This sea anemone is 
found in the shallow brackish water of coastal lagoons and salt 
marshes where its slender column is usually buried in the mud and its 
tentacles exposed. Its genome has been sequenced and it is cultivated 
in the laboratory as a model organism, but the IUCN has listed it as 
being a "Vulnerable species" in the wild.
