**About *Ichneumon xanthorius ***
-------------------------

The Ichneumonidae, also known as ichneumon wasps, ichneumonid wasps,
ichneumonids, or Darwin wasps, are a family of parasitoid wasps of the
insect order Hymenoptera. They are one of the most diverse groups within
the Hymenoptera with roughly 25,000 species currently described.
However, this likely represents less than a quarter of their true
richness as reliable estimates are lacking, along with much of the most
basic knowledge about their ecology, distribution, and evolution. It
is estimated that there are more species in this family than there are
species of birds and mammals combined. Ichneumonid wasps, with very
few exceptions, attack the immature stages of holometabolous insects and
spiders, eventually killing their hosts. They thus fulfill an
important role as regulators of insect populations, both in natural and
semi-natural systems, making them promising agents for biological
control.
