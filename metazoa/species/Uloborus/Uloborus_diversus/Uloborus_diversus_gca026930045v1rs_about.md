**About *Uloborus diversus***
-------------------------
*Uloborus diversus* is a species of cribellate orb weaver in the 
spider family Uloboridae. It is found in the desert regions of the 
Southwestern United States and Mexico. It is an important model 
species for understanding the evolution of spidroins and understanding 
orb-weaving behavior. To provide resources for this research a 
2.15-Gbp chromosome-level draft genome assembly was sequenced and 
assembled to 10 chromosomes.
