**About *Cydia pomonella***
-------------------------
The codling moth (*Cydia pomonella*) is a member of the Lepidopteran 
family Tortricidae. They are major pests to agricultural crops, mainly 
fruits such as apples and pears, and a codling moth larva is often 
called an "apple worm". Because the larvae are not able to feed on 
leaves, they are highly dependent on fruits as a food source and thus 
have a significant impact on crops. The caterpillars bore into fruit 
and stop it from growing, which leads to premature ripening. Various 
means of control, including chemical, biological, and preventive, have 
been implemented. This moth has a widespread distribution, being found 
on six continents. Adaptive behavior such as diapause and multiple 
generations per breeding season have allowed this moth to persist even 
during years of bad climatic conditions.
