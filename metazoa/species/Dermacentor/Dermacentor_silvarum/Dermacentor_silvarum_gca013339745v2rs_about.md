**About *Dermacentor silvarum***
-------------------------

*Dermacentor* is a genus of ticks in the family Ixodidae, the hard ticks.
The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, with native species on all
continents except Australia. Most are found in North America.[2]

Hosts of Dermacentor ticks include many large and small mammals,
including horses, deer, cattle, lagomorphs, peccaries, porcupines,
tapirs, desert bighorn sheep, and humans [1].

Dermacentor species are vectors of many pathogens, including *Rickettsia
rickettsii*, which causes the disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
*Coxiella burnetii*, which causes Q fever, *Anaplasma marginale*, which
causes anaplasmosis in cattle [1]. Dermacentor ticks
inject a neurotoxin that causes tick paralysis [1].
