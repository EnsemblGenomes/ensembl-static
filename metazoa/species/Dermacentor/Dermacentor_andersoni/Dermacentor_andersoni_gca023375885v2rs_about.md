**About *Dermacentor andersoni***
-------------------------
*Dermacentor andersoni*, commonly known as the Rocky Mountain wood 
tick, is a hard tick, or member of the Ixodidae family, with three 
life stages including larvae, nymph, and finally adult, or, more 
entomologically, imago. This tick is generally located in the 
northwest United States and southwest Canada along the Rocky 
Mountains. This tick is generally a vector for Colorado tick fever, 
but can also be a vector for Rocky Mountain spotted fever and 
tularemia. During the larval and nymphal stages, the tick does not 
feed on humans, but during the adult stage, it will.
