**About *Pectinophora gossypiella***
-------------------------
The pink bollworm (*Pectinophora gossypiella*) is an insect known for 
being a pest in cotton farming. The adult is a small, thin, gray moth 
with fringed wings. The larva is a dull white caterpillar with eight 
pairs of legs with conspicuous pink banding along its dorsum. The 
larva reaches one half inch in length.

The female moth lays eggs in a cotton boll, and when the larvae 
emerge from the eggs, they inflict damage through feeding. They 
chew through the cotton lint to feed on the seeds. Since cotton 
is used for both fiber and seed oil, the damage is twofold. 
Their disruption of the protective tissue around the boll is a 
portal of entry for other insects and fungi.
