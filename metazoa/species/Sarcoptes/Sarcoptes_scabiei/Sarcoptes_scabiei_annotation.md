----------

Ensembl Metazoa displays the SscaA1.2 (August 2017) gene set from
[VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org/organisms/sarcoptes-scabiei-var-canis).
Genes were annotated with MAKER, combining EST data with *de novo*
prediction methods \[1\]; non-coding RNA genes were added with the
[Ensembl Genomes pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html).
