Annotation
----------

Genes were predicted for *Megaselia scalaris* using the MAKER pipeline,
resulting in 11,461 protein-coding genes. Non-coding RNA genes were
added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed.
