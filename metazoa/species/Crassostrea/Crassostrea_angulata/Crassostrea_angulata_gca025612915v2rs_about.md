**About *Crassostrea angulata***
-------------------------
The Portuguese oyster is a species of oyster found in the southwest 
Iberian Peninsula, closely related to the Pacific oyster. Although 
first identified as a native European species, genetic studies have 
suggested the Portuguese oyster originated from the Pacific coast of 
Asia and was introduced to Europe by Portuguese trading ships in the 
16th century. The species is usually found in coastal river mouths and 
estuaries.
