Annotation
----------

The protein-coding genes displayed in Ensembl Genomes are imported from
the set of [GigaDB](http://gigadb.org/dataset/100030) genes that were
accepted as INSDC records (1928 genes were rejected when submitted to
INSDC), plus 2 additional genes in INDSC that are not in GigaDB.
Non-coding RNA genes were added using the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html), and BLAST hits and
protein features have been computed.
