**About *Daphnia carinata***
-------------------------

The water ﬂea *Daphnia carinata* is emerging as a new model for biological studies due to its natural cyclical parthenogenesis and small genome [1]. 
*Daphnia* is a genus of small planktonic crustaceans, 0.2–6.0 mm (0.01–0.24 in) in length. *Daphnia* are members of the order Anomopoda, and are one of 
the several small aquatic crustaceans commonly called water fleas because their saltatory swimming style resembles the movements of fleas. 
*Daphnia* spp. live in various aquatic environments ranging from acidic swamps to freshwater lakes and ponds.
