**About *Daphnia pulicaria***
-------------------------
*Daphnia pulicaria* is a species of freshwater crustaceans found 
within the genus of Daphnia, which are often called "water fleas," and 
they are commonly used as model organisms for scientific research Like 
other species of Daphnia, they reproduce via cyclic parthenogenesis. 
D. pulicaria are filter-feeders with a diet primarily consisting of 
algae, including Ankistrodesmus falcatus, and they can be found in 
deep lakes located in temperate climates. Furthermore, D. pulicaria 
are ecologically important herbivorous zooplankton, which help control 
algal populations and are a source of food for some fish. D. pulicaria 
are closely related to Daphnia pulex, and numerous studies have 
investigated the nature and strength of this relationship because 
these species can produce Daphnia pulex-pulicaria hybrids. In recent 
years, D. pulicaria along with other Daphnia species have been 
negatively affected by invasive predators, such as Bythotrephes 
longimanus.
