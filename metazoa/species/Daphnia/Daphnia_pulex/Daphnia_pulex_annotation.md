Annotation
----------

Gene models were predicted using *ab initio* and homology-based methods
(FGENESH, GENEWISE, SNAP, PASA and Gnomon). The automated annotation was
followed by a distributed community-wide manual curation. Since release
22 (March 2014), Ensembl Genomes has displayed the ENA gene set; this
gene set is a subset of the original JGI gene set, therefore all genes
contain a JGI cross reference. Between Ensembl Genomes release 21 and
release 22, 304 protein-coding genes were removed, and 23 new
pseudogenes were imported. Non-coding RNA genes were added using the
[Ensembl Genomes pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html),
and BLAST hits and protein features have been computed. Additional data
is available at [wFleaBase](http://wfleabase.org/) \[2\].
