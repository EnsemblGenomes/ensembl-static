The [gene
models](http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/daphnia/daphnia_magna/Docs/Dmagna7f_evigene_about201410.txt)
were predicted at Indiana University and submitted to ENA from where
Ensembl Genomes imported the data. Non-coding RNA genes were added using
the [Ensembl Genomes
pipeline](https://metazoa.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/ncrna.html). Additional data is
available at [wFleaBase](http://wfleabase.org/) \[1\].
