Fusarium oxysporum  (Schlecht as emended by Snyder and Hansen), an ascomycete
fungus, comprises all the species, varieties and forms recognized by Wollenweber
and Reinking within an infrageneric grouping called section Elegans. It is part
of the family Nectriaceae.
Although their predominant role in native soils may be as harmless or even
beneficial plant endophytes or soil saprophytes, many strains within the F.
oxysporum complex are pathogenic to plants, especially in agricultural settings.
