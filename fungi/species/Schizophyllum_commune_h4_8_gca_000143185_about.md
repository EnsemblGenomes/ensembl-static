---------------------------------------------------



***Schizophyllum commune*** is a species of fungus in the genus
*Schizophyllum*. The mushroom resembles undulating waves of tightly
packed corals or loose chinese fan. \"Gillies\" or Split Gills vary from
creamy yellow to pale white in colour. The cap is small, 1-4.5Â cm wide
with a dense yet spongey body texture. It is known as the split-gill
mushroom because of the unique longitudinally divided nature of the gill
producing basidospores, which often splits when they dry out and
moistened into gills as they shed into spores. It is the only known
fungi capable of retracting by movement. This mushroom is found
predominantly in Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Madagascar,
Nigeria and Northeastern India. It is found in the wild on decaying
trees after rainy seasons followed by dry spells where the mushrooms are
naturally collected. it is known for its high medicinal value and
aromatic taste profile. It has recently attracted the medicinal industry
for its immunomodulatory, antifungal, antineoplastic and antiviral
activities that are higher than those of any other glucan complex
carbohydrate.
