**About *Candida parapsilosis***
-------------------------
*Candida parapsilosis* is a fungal species of yeast that has become a 
significant cause of sepsis and of wound and tissue infections in 
immunocompromised people. Unlike Candida albicans and Candida 
tropicalis, C. parapsilosis is not an obligate human pathogen, having 
been isolated from nonhuman sources such as domestic animals, insects 
and soil. C. parapsilosis is also a normal human commensal and it is 
one of the fungi most frequently isolated from human hands. There are 
several risk factors that can contribute to C. parapsilosis 
colonization. Immunocompromised individuals and surgical patients, 
particularly those undergoing surgery of the gastrointestinal tract, 
are at high risk for infection with C. parapsilosis. There is 
currently no consensus on the treatment of invasive candidiasis caused 
by C. parapsilosis, although the therapeutic approach typically 
includes the removal of foreign bodies such as implanted prostheses 
and the administration of systemic antifungal therapy. amphotericin B 
and fluconazole are often used in the treatment of C. parapsilosis 
infection.
