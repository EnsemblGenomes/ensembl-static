**About *Beauveria bassiana***
-------------------------
*Beauveria bassiana* is a fungus that grows naturally in soils 
throughout the world and acts as a parasite on various arthropod 
species, causing white muscardine disease; it thus belongs to the 
group of entomopathogenic fungi. It is used as a biological 
insecticide to control a number of pests, including termites, thrips, 
whiteflies, aphids and various beetles. Its use in the control of bed 
bugs and malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.
