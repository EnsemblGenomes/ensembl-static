About the *Phaeosphaeria nodorum* genome
----------------------------------------

*Phaeosphaeria nodorum* is a major fungal pathogen of wheat (*Triticum
aestivum*) and a member of the Dothideomycetes, a large fungal taxon
that includes many important plant pathogens affecting all major crop
plant families.

The Dothideomycetes is a newly recognised major class of filamentous
fungi that replaces the long-recognized loculoascomycetes. It includes
the causal organisms of many economically important plant diseases.

The infection occurs in repeated cycles of both asexual and sexual
infection throughout the growing season. New rounds of infection are
initiated by rain-splash or wind dispersal of spores. Infection begins
when spores land on leaf tissue. The spores rapidly germinate to produce
long, branching threadlike structures, called hyphae. The hyphae invade
the leaf, using specialised branches to gain entry to the outermost
layer of cells on the leaves. They can also grow directly through pores
in the leaves. The hyphae rapidly colonize the leaves and begin to
produce asexual fruiting bodies.

*Phaeosphaeria nodorum* is an experimentally tractable organism, which
is easily handled in defined media. It was one of the first fungal
pathogens to be genetically manipulated. *Phaeosphaeria nodorum* has
been a model for fungicide development and emerged as a model for
dothideomycete pathology.
