**About *Candida albicans***
-------------------------
*Candida albicans* is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast that is a 
common member of the human gut flora. It can also survive outside the 
human body. It is detected in the gastrointestinal tract and mouth in 
40–60% of healthy adults. It is usually a commensal organism, but it 
can become pathogenic in immunocompromised individuals under a variety 
of conditions. It is one of the few species of the genus Candida that 
cause the human infection candidiasis, which results from an 
overgrowth of the fungus. Candidiasis is, for example, often observed 
in HIV-infected patients.

C. albicans is the most common fungal species isolated from biofilms 
either formed on (permanent) implanted medical devices or on human 
tissue. C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata 
are together responsible for 50–90% of all cases of candidiasis in 
humans. A mortality rate of 40% has been reported for patients with 
systemic candidiasis due to C. albicans. By one estimate, invasive 
candidiasis contracted in a hospital causes 2,800 to 11,200 deaths 
yearly in the US. Nevertheless, these numbers may not truly reflect 
the true extent of damage this organism causes, given studies 
indicating that C. albicans can cross the blood–brain barrier in mice.
