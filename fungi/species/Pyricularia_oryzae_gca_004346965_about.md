Magnaporthe grisea, also known as rice blast fungus, rice rotten neck, rice
seedling blight, blast of rice, oval leaf spot of graminea, pitting disease,
ryegrass blast, Johnson spot, that causes a serious disease affecting rice. It
is now known that M. grisea consists of a cryptic species complex containing at
least two biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not
interbreed. Confusion on which of these two names to use for the rice blast
pathogen remains, as both are now used by different authors.
Members of the Magnaporthe grisea complex can also infect other agriculturally
important cereals including wheat, rye, barley, and pearl millet causing
diseases called blast disease or blight disease. Rice blast causes economically
significant crop losses annually. Each year it is estimated to destroy enough
rice to feed more than 60 million people. The fungus is known to occur in 85
countries worldwide and  was the most devastating fungal plant pathogen in the
world.
