**About *Aspergillus terreus NIH2624***
-------------------------
Aspergillus terreus, also known as Aspergillus terrestris, is a fungus 
(mold) found worldwide in soil. Although thought to be strictly 
asexual until recently, A. terreus is now known to be capable of 
sexual reproduction. This saprotrophic fungus is prevalent in warmer 
climates such as tropical and subtropical regions. Aside from being 
located in soil, A. terreus has also been found in habitats such as 
decomposing vegetation and dust. A. terreus is commonly used in 
industry to produce important organic acids, such as itaconic acid and 
cis-aconitic acid, as well as enzymes, like xylanase. It was also the 
initial source for the drug mevinolin (lovastatin), a drug for 
lowering serum cholesterol.
