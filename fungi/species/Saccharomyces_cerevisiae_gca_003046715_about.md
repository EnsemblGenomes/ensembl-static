Saccharomyces cerevisiae () is a species of yeast (single-celled fungus
microorganisms). The species has been instrumental in winemaking, baking, and
brewing since ancient times. It is believed to have been originally isolated
from the skin of grapes. It is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic
model organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like Escherichia coli as the
model bacterium. It is the microorganism behind the most common type of
fermentation. S. cerevisiae cells are round to ovoid, 5–10 μm in diameter. It
reproduces by budding.
Many proteins important in human biology were first discovered by studying their
homologs in yeast; these proteins include cell cycle proteins, signaling
proteins, and protein-processing enzymes. S. cerevisiae is currently the only
yeast cell known to have Berkeley bodies present, which are involved in
particular secretory pathways. Antibodies against S. cerevisiae are found in
60–70% of patients with Crohn's disease and 10–15% of patients with ulcerative
colitis (and 8% of healthy controls). S. cerevisiae has been found to contribute
to the smell of bread; the proline and ornithine present in yeast are precursors
of the 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline, a roast‐smelling odorant, in the bread crust.
