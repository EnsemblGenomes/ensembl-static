Aspergillus niger is a fungus and one of the most common species of the genus
Aspergillus.
It causes a disease called "black mold" on certain fruits and vegetables such as
grapes, apricots, onions, and peanuts, and is a common contaminant of food. It
is ubiquitous in soil and is commonly reported from indoor environments, where
its black colonies can be confused with those of Stachybotrys (species of which
have also been called "black mold"). It also produces the isoflavone orobol.
