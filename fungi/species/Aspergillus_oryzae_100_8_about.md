About *Aspergillus oryzae 100-8* 
--------------------------------



***Aspergillus oryzae***, known in English as ***kōji*** (from Japanese
*kōji* 麹), is a filamentous fungus (a mold) used in Chinese and other
East Asian cuisines to ferment soybeans for making soy sauce and
fermented bean paste, and also to saccharify rice, other grains, and
potatoes in the making of alcoholic beverages such as *huangjiu*,
*sake*, *makgeolli*, and *shōchū*. The domestication of *A. oryzae*
occurred at least 2000 years ago. *A. oryzae* is also used for the
production of rice vinegars.

Dr. Eiji Ichishima of Tohoku University called the *kōji* fungus a
\"national fungus\" (*kokkin*) in the journal of the Brewing Society of
Japan, because of its importance not only for making the *koji* for
*sake* brewing, but also for making the *koji* for *miso*, soy sauce,
and a range of other traditional Japanese foods. His proposal was
approved at the society\'s annual meeting in 2006.

\"Red *kōji-kin*\" is a separate species, *Monascus purpureus*.
