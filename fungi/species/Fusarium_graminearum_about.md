**About *Fusarium graminearum***
-------------------------
Gibberella zeae, also known by the name of its anamorph *Fusarium 
graminearum*, is a fungal plant pathogen which causes fusarium head 
blight (FHB), a devastating disease on wheat and barley. The pathogen 
is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide 
each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of 
wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining 
grain with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol (DON), which inhibits 
protein biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These 
toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in 
livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. 
Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against F. graminearum, 
no completely resistant variety is currently available. Research on 
the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining insight into 
more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the 
life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect 
wheat from scab infection.
