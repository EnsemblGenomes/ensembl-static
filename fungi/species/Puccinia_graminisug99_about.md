**About *Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Ug99***
-------------------------
Stem rust, also known as cereal rust, black rust, red rust or red 
dust, is caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis, which causes 
significant disease in cereal crops. Crop species that are affected by 
the disease include bread wheat, durum wheat, barley and triticale. 
These diseases have affected cereal farming throughout history. The 
annual recurrence of stem rust of wheat in North Indian plains was 
discovered by K. C. Mehta. Since the 1950s, wheat strains bred to be 
resistant to stem rust have become available. Fungicides effective 
against stem rust are available as well.
