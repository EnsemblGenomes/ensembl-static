**About *Fusarium pseudograminearum CS3096***
-------------------------
Crown rot of wheat is caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium 
pseudograminearum. F. pseudograminearum is a member of the fungal 
phylum Ascomycota and is also known as Gibberella coronicola 
(teleomorph). It is a monoecious fungus, meaning it does not require 
another host other than wheat to complete its life cycle. Although F. 
pseudograminearum can produce both anamorphic and teleomorphic states, 
the teleomorph is usually not present for crown rot of wheat. This 
Fusarium species has, until recently, been considered to be the same 
as the species known as Fusarium graminearum due to many similar 
characteristics. One of the only differences between the two species 
is that F. pseudograminearum lacks its sexual stage on the wheat host.
