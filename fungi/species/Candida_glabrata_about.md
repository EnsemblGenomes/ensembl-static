**About *Candida glabrata***
-------------------------
Nakaseomyces glabratus is a species of haploid yeast of the genus 
Nakaseomyces, previously known as *Candida glabrata*. Despite the fact 
that no sexual life cycle has been documented for this species, N. 
glabratus strains of both mating types are commonly found. N. glabrata 
is generally a commensal of human mucosal tissues, but in today's era 
of wider human immunodeficiency from various causes, N. glabratus is 
often the second or third most common cause of candidiasis as an 
opportunistic pathogen. Infections caused by N. glabratus can affect 
the urogenital tract or even cause systemic infections by entrance of 
the fungal cells in the bloodstream (Candidemia), especially prevalent 
in immunocompromised patients.
