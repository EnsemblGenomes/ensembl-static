About the *Magnaporthe oryzae* genome
-------------------------------------

*Magnaporthe oryzae* (anamorph: *Pyricularia grisea*) also known as rice
blast fungus is an important plant pathogen isolated from rice and a
variety of other rice field weeds. It affects all growth stages of the
plant with severe damage during the seedling stage. This fungi generates
spores that can easily be dispersed by wind and splashing rain. The
spores can spend the Winter in rice grains and rice stubble and can
infect new crops the following year. Infection is more likely over long
periods of rain or high humidity. There are known strains of rice
resistant to this disease that may be helpful for it control.
*Magnaporthe oryzae* is the most important rice pathogen worldwide known
to occur in 85 countries. Every year, the losses in crops due to rice
blast could feed 60 million people. The *Magnaporthe oryzae* genome was
release as part of the *Magnaporthe* comparative database, it as size of
41.03 Mb and encodes about 12,593 protein-coding genes.
