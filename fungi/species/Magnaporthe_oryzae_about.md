**About *Magnaporthe oryzae 70-15***
-------------------------
Magnaporthe grisea, also known as rice blast fungus, rice rotten neck, 
rice seedling blight, blast of rice, oval leaf spot of graminea, 
pitting disease, ryegrass blast, Johnson spot, neck blast, wheat blast 
and Imochi (稲熱), is a plant-pathogenic fungus and model organism that 
causes a serious disease affecting rice. It is now known that M. 
grisea consists of a cryptic species complex containing at least two 
biological species that have clear genetic differences and do not 
interbreed. Complex members isolated from Digitaria have been more 
narrowly defined as M. grisea. The remaining members of the complex 
isolated from rice and a variety of other hosts have been renamed 
Magnaporthe oryzae, within the same M. grisea complex. Confusion on 
which of these two names to use for the rice blast pathogen remains, 
as both are now used by different authors.
