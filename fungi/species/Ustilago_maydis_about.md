About the *Ustilago maydis* genome
----------------------------------

*Ustilago maydis* is the causal agent of the corn smut crop disease.
This basidiomycete can infect any part of the plant but usually it
reaches the ovaries which causes the kernels to grow into large greyish
tumors. The infected kernels are known as \"huitlacoche\" in Mexico and
are used in the preparation of meals. This species is one of the most
well studied plant pathogens and an important model organism for
studying plant-pathogen interactions. The *Ustilago maydis* genome was
released in June 2003 consisting of a 10X whole-genome shotgun assembly
with a size of 19.68 Mb and encodes about 6500 protein-coding genes.
