**About *Mycosarcoma maydis***
-------------------------
Corn smut is a plant disease caused by the pathogenic fungus 
*Mycosarcoma maydis*, synonym Ustilago maydis. One of several cereal 
crop pathogens called smut, the fungus forms galls on all above-ground 
parts of corn species such as maize and teosinte. The infected corn is 
edible; in Mexico, it is considered a delicacy, called huitlacoche, 
often eaten as a filling in quesadillas and other tortilla-based 
dishes, as well as in soups.
