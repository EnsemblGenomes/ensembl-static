About the *Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici* genome
-------------------------------------------------------

*Fusarium oxysporum* comprises a group of soil inhabitants that can
exist as saprophytes in the soil debris but also as pervasive plant
endophytes colonizing the plant roots. Many strains of these species are
pathogenic to plant crops. One of these strains, *Fusarium oxysporum
f.sp. lycopersici*, is the causal agent of fusarium wilt in tomatoes.
The first symptoms of the plant are yellowing and weakness in one side
of the plant and progress with wilting of the leaves and browning of the
vascular system leading eventually to leaf death and inhability to
produce fruits.

The genome sequence, assembly and protein coding genes annotation of the
*Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici* (4287) genome have been generated
by the [Broad Institute](http://www.broadinstitute.org) as part of their
work on the [*Fusarium* Comparative Sequencing
Project](http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/MultiHome.html).
The genome has been sequenced to a coverage of 6x and has a total
estimated size of 59.9 Mb represented in 114 scaffolds.
