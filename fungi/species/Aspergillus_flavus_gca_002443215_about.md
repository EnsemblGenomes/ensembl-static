Aspergillus flavus is a saprotrophic and pathogenic fungus with a cosmopolitan
distribution. It is best known for its colonization of cereal grains, legumes,
and tree nuts. Postharvest rot typically develops during harvest, storage,
and/or transit. Its specific name flavus derives from the Latin meaning yellow,
a reference to the frequently observed colour of the spores. A. flavus
infections can occur while hosts are still in the field (preharvest), but often
show no symptoms (dormancy) until postharvest storage and/or transport. In
addition to causing preharvest and postharvest infections, many strains produce
significant quantities of toxic compounds known as mycotoxins, which, when
consumed, are toxic to mammals. A. flavus is also an opportunistic human and
animal pathogen, causing aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals.
