**About *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum 1980 UF-70***
-------------------------
Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is a plant pathogenic fungus and can cause a 
disease called white mold if conditions are conducive. S. sclerotiorum 
can also be known as cottony rot, watery soft rot, stem rot, drop, 
crown rot and blossom blight. A key characteristic of this pathogen is 
its ability to produce black resting structures known as sclerotia and 
white fuzzy growths of mycelium on the plant it infects. These 
sclerotia give rise to a fruiting body in the spring that produces 
spores in a sac which is why fungi in this class are called sac fungi 
(Ascomycota). This pathogen can occur on many continents and has a 
wide host range of plants. When S. sclerotiorum is onset in the field 
by favorable environmental conditions, losses can be great and control 
measures should be considered.
