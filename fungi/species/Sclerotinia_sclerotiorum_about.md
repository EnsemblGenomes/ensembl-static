About the *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* genome
-------------------------------------------

*Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* is the causal agent of a disease known as
white mold. This Ascomycete can infect a wide range of plants in any
stage of growth and is widespread in all continents. Some of the hosts
are cabbage, common bean, citrus, celery, coriander, melon, squash,
soybean, tomato, lettuce, and cucumber. This fungus proliferates under
moist conditions which means that crops more susceptible to this
pathogen should be planted in well-drained soils.

The genome of the strain 1980 (ATCC18683) of *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*
was submitted to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank in 2005 consisting of an 8X
whole-genome assembly which encodes about 10,175 protein-coding genes.
