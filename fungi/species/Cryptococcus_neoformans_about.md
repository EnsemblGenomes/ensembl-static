**About *Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans JEC21***
-------------------------
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated basidiomycetous yeast 
belonging to the class Tremellomycetes and an obligate aerobe that can 
live in both plants and animals. Its teleomorph is a filamentous 
fungus, formerly referred to Filobasidiella neoformans. In its yeast 
state, it is often found in bird excrement. It has remarkable genomic 
plasticity and genetic variability between its strains, making 
treatment of the disease it causes difficult. Cryptococcus neoformans 
causes disease primarily in immunocompromised hosts, such as HIV or 
cancer patients. In addition it has been shown to cause disease in 
apparently immunocompetent hosts, especially in developed countries.
