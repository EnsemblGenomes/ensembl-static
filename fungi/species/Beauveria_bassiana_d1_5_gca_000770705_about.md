About *Beauveria bassiana D1-5 (GCA\_000770705)* 
------------------------------------------------



***Beauveria bassiana*** is a fungus that grows naturally in soils
throughout the world and acts as a parasite on various arthropod
species, causing **white muscardine disease**; it thus belongs to the
entomopathogenic fungi. It is being used as a biological insecticide to
control a number of pests such as termites, thrips, whiteflies, aphids
and different beetles. Its use in the control of bedbugs and
malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.
