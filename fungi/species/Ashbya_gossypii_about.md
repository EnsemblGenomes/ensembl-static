**About *Ashbya gossypii ATCC 10895***
-------------------------
Eremothecium gossypii (also known as Ashbya gossypii) is a filamentous 
fungus or mold closely related to yeast, but growing exclusively in a 
filamentous way. It was originally isolated from cotton as a pathogen 
causing stigmatomycosis by Ashby and Nowell in 1926. This disease 
affects the development of hair cells in cotton bolls and can be 
transmitted to citrus fruits, which thereupon dry out and collapse 
(dry rot disease). In the first part of the 20th century, E. gossypii 
and two other fungi causing stigmatomycosis (Eremothecium coryli, 
Aureobasidium pullulans) made it virtually impossible to grow cotton 
in certain regions of the subtropics, causing severe economical 
losses. Control of the spore-transmitting insects - cotton stainer 
(Dysdercus suturellus) and Antestiopsis (antestia bugs) - permitted 
full eradication of infections. E. gossypii was recognized as a 
natural overproducer of riboflavin (vitamin B2), which protects its 
spores against ultraviolet light. This made it an interesting organism 
for industries, where genetically modified strains are still used to 
produce this vitamin.
