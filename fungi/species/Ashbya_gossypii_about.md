About the *Ashbya gossypii* genome
----------------------------------

More than 90% of *Ashbya gossypii* genes show both homology and a
particular pattern of synteny with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It was
originally isolated from cotton as a pathogen causing stigmatomycosis by
Ashby and Novell in 1926. The *Ashbya gossypii* genome project was
initiated when conservation of gene order and orientation (synteny) to
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was noted.

*Ashbya gossypii* became recognized as an attractive model to study the
growth of long and multinucleate fungal cells (hyphae) because of its
small genome, haploid nuclei, and efficient gene targeting methods. It
is generally assumed that a better understanding of filamentous fungal
growth will greatly stimulate the development of novel fungicides.
