**About *Aspergillus lentulus***
-------------------------
*Aspergillus lentulus* is a species of Aspergillus fungus. It is a 
close relative of Aspergillus fumigatus. It has smaller conidial heads 
with diminutive vesicles compared to A.fumigatus, and cannot survive 
at 48°C (118°F). It also has decreased in vitro susceptibilities to 
multiple antifungals, including amphotericin B, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, and caspofungin. Aspergillus lentulus is an 
opportunistic human pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis with 
high mortality rates. It has been isolated from clinical and 
environmental sources. Since it was described in 2005 as a new 
species, it was thought to reproduce only asexually. However, in 2013 
Swilaiman et al. (2013) found that A. lentulus has a functional sexual 
cycle. During this cycle cleistothecia are produced that, when mature, 
contain heat-resistant ascospores.
