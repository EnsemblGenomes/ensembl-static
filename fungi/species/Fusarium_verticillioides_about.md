About the *Fusarium verticillioides* genome
-------------------------------------------

*Fusarium verticillioides* [is a fungal plant pathogen. It causes a
disease in rice called
]{style="line-height: 1.5em;"}[bakanae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakanae)[,
which is japanese and means \"foolish seedlings\". The afflicted plants
are at best infertile with empty panicles, producing no edible grains;
at worst, they are incapable of supporting their own weight, topple
over, and die (hence \"foolish
seedling\").]{style="line-height: 1.5em;"}

The earliest known report of bakanae is from 1828. Bakanae affects rice
crops in Asia, Africa, and North America; in 2003, the International
Rice Research Institute estimated bakanae-related crop losses at between
20% and 50%.

*Fusarium verticillioides* is the causal agent of kernel and ear rot of
maize. This destructive disease occurs virtually everywhere that maize
is grown worldwide. In years with high temperatures, drought, and heavy
insect damage, the disease can significantly diminish crop quality.

The most significant economic impact of *Fusarium verticillioides*[ is
its ability to produce fumonisin mycotoxins. Various diseases caused by
fumonisins have been reported in animals, such as liver and kidney
cancer. In 2003, fumonisin B1, the fumonisin produced most abundantly by
]{style="line-height: 1.5em;"}*Gibberella moniliformis*[, was added to
the California Proposition 65 List of Substances Known to Cause
Cancer.]{style="line-height: 1.5em;"}

*Fusarium verticillioides*[ is also known as
]{style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;"}*Gibberella moniliformis,* [a
name by which it was previously known in Ensembl Fungi, and is also
known under many other names.
]{style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;"}*Fusarium verticillioides* is
a Fusarium. The genus Fusarium collectively represents the most
important group of fungal plant pathogens, causing various diseases on
nearly every economically important plant species. Of equal concern is
the health hazard posed to humans and livestock by the plethora of
Fusarium mycotoxins. Besides their economic importance, species of
Fusarium also serve as key model organisms for biological and
evolutionary research.

In humans with normal immune systems, fusarial infections may occur in
the nails and in the eye. In humans whose immune systems are weakened in
a particular way, aggressive fusarial infections penetrating the entire
body and bloodstream may be caused by members of the Fusarium solani
complex, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium
proliferatum and, rarely, other fusarial species.
