**About *Candida auris***
-------------------------
*Candida auris* is a species of fungus that grows as yeast. It is one 
of the few species of the genus Candida which cause candidiasis in 
humans. Often, candidiasis is acquired in hospitals by patients with 
weakened immune systems. C. auris can cause invasive candidiasis 
(fungemia) in which the bloodstream, the central nervous system, and 
internal organs are infected. It has attracted widespread attention 
because of its multiple drug resistance. Treatment is also complicated 
because it is easily misidentified as other Candida species.
