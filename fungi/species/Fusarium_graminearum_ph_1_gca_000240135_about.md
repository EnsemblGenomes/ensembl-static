Gibberella zeae, also known by the name of its anamorph Fusarium graminearum, is
a fungal plant pathogen which causes fusarium head blight, a devastating disease
on wheat and barley. The pathogen is responsible for billions of dollars in
economic losses worldwide each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid
composition of wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the
remaining grain with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol, which inhibits protein
biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins cause
vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful
to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance
genes against F. graminearum, no completely resistant variety is currently
available. Research on the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining
insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in
the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat
from scab infection.
