**About *Puccinia triticina***
-------------------------
Wheat leaf rust is a fungal disease that affects wheat, barley, rye 
stems, leaves and grains. In temperate zones it is destructive on 
winter wheat because the pathogen overwinters. Infections can lead up 
to 20% yield loss. The pathogen is a Puccinia rust fungus. It is the 
most prevalent of all the wheat rust diseases, occurring in most 
wheat-growing regions. It causes serious epidemics in North America, 
Mexico and South America and is a devastating seasonal disease in 
India. P. triticina is heteroecious, requiring two distinct hosts.
