**About *Aspergillus niger***
-------------------------
*Aspergillus niger* is a mold classified within the Nigri section of 
the Aspergillus genus. The Aspergillus genus consists of common molds 
found throughout the environment within soil and water, on vegetation, 
in fecal matter, on decomposing matter, and suspended in the air. 
Species within this genus often grow quickly and can sporulate within 
a few days of germination. A combination of characteristics unique to 
A. niger makes the microbe invaluable to the production of many acids, 
proteins and bioactive compounds. Characteristics including extensive 
metabolic diversity, high production yield, secretion capability, and 
the ability to conduct post-translational modifications are 
responsible for A. niger's robust production of secondary metabolites. 
A. niger's capability to withstand extremely acidic conditions makes 
it especially important to the industrial production of citric acid.
