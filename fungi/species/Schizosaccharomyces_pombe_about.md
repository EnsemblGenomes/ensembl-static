Schizosaccharomyces pombe, also called "fission yeast 
(*Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-*)", is a species of yeast used in 
traditional brewing and as a model organism in molecular and cell 
biology. It is a unicellular eukaryote, whose cells are rod-shaped. 
Cells typically measure 3 to 4 micrometres in diameter and 7 to 14 
micrometres in length. Its genome, which is approximately 14.1 million
