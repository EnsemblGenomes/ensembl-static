About the *Neurospora\_crassa* genome
-------------------------------------

*Neurospora crassa* is a red bread mold of the phylum *Ascomycota* which
is widely used in genetics as a model organism. The *Neurospora* genome,
published in 2003, is approximately 40 Mb in size, and encodes about
10,000 protein-coding genes. The Genome analysis has revealed that
Neurospora possesses a wide variety of epigenetics mechanisms and
related genome defence mechanisms, including a process unique to fungi
called Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP).
