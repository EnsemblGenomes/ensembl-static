**About *Magnaporthe poae ATCC 64411***
-------------------------
Magnaporthe poae is an ascomycete fungus which causes the turfgrass 
disease commonly known as summer patch, or Poa patch. The disease 
occurs mostly on Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), Fescues (Festuca 
sp.), and on Annual bluegrass (Poa annua). Bentgrass may also become 
infected but shows very few symptoms and quickly recovers. Summer 
Patch will usually become noticeable between June and September, 
although small signs can appear at any time but are not noticeable 
because the turfgrass can recover quickly.
