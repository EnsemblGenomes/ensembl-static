About the *Magnaporthe poae* genome
-----------------------------------

*Magnaporthe poae* is the causal agent of the \"summer patch\" disease
in *Poa* species, creeping bentgrass and fine-leaved fescues. Many of
the affected species are important pasture plants. Others like the
Kentucky bluegrass (*Poa pratensis*) are used as cool-season grass in
home lawns, urban green spaces, parks, sports fields and gold courses.
\"Summer patch\" symptoms become noticeable between June and September
and are very similar to a necrotic ring spot which may lead to a wrong
diagnosis. The disease spreads better under extended periods of humid
weather and daytime high temperatures in midsummer. *Magnaporthe poae*
infection can be controlled using disease resistant strains, adequate
drainage and reduced soil compaction. If the disease is severe enough or
on high end valued turf (golf greens), fungicides can be applied usually
on a preventive basis. The genome of *Magnaporthe poae* has a size of
about 39.5 Mb and contains 11,209 protein coding genes.
