**About *Trichoderma virens Gv29-8***
-------------------------
Trichoderma is a genus of fungi in the family Hypocreaceae that is 
present in all soils, where they are the most prevalent culturable 
fungi. Many species in this genus can be characterized as 
opportunistic avirulent plant symbionts. This refers to the ability of 
several Trichoderma species to form mutualistic endophytic 
relationships with several plant species. Trichoderma species are also 
responsible for green mold disease in mushroom cultivation. The 
genomes of several Trichoderma species have been sequenced and are 
publicly available from the JGI.
