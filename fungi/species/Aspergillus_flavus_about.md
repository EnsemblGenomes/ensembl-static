**About *Aspergillus flavus NRRL3357***
-------------------------
Aspergillus flavus is a saprotrophic and pathogenic fungus with a 
cosmopolitan distribution. It is best known for its colonization of 
cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts. Postharvest rot typically 
develops during harvest, storage, and/or transit. Its specific name 
flavus derives from the Latin meaning yellow, a reference to the 
frequently observed colour of the spores. A. flavus infections can 
occur while hosts are still in the field (preharvest), but often show 
no symptoms (dormancy) until postharvest storage or transport.
