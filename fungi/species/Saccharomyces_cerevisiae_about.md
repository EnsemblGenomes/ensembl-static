**About *Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c***
-------------------------
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of yeast. The species has been 
instrumental in winemaking, baking, and brewing since ancient times. 
It is believed to have been originally isolated from the skin of 
grapes. It is one of the most intensively studied eukaryotic model 
organisms in molecular and cell biology, much like Escherichia coli as 
the model bacterium. It is the microorganism which causes many common 
types of fermentation. S. cerevisiae cells are round to ovoid, 5–10 μm 
in diameter. It reproduces by budding.
