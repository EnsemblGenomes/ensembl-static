**About *Yarrowia lipolytica CLIB122***
-------------------------
Yarrowia is a fungal genus in the family Dipodascaceae. For a while 
the genus was monotypic, containing the single species Yarrowia 
lipolytica, a yeast that can use unusual carbon sources, such as 
hydrocarbons. This has made it of interest for use in industrial 
microbiology, especially for the production of specialty lipids. 
Molecular phylogenetics analysis has revealed several other species 
that have since been added to the genus.
