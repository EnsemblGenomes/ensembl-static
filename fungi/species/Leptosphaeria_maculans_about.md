**About *Leptosphaeria maculans JN3***
-------------------------
Leptosphaeria maculans is a fungal pathogen of the phylum Ascomycota 
that is the causal agent of blackleg disease on Brassica crops. Its 
genome has been sequenced, and L. maculans is a well-studied model 
phytopathogenic fungus. Symptoms of blackleg generally include basal 
stem cankers, small grey lesions on leaves, and root rot. The major 
yield loss is due to stem canker. The fungus is dispersed by the wind 
as ascospores or rain splash in the case of the conidia. L. maculans 
grows best in wet conditions and a temperature range of 5â€“20 degrees 
Celsius. Rotation of crops, removal of stubble, application of 
fungicide, and crop resistance are all used to manage blackleg. The 
fungus is an important pathogen of Brassica napus (canola) crops.
