About the *Leptosphaeria maculans* genome
-----------------------------------------

*Leptosphaeria maculans* (anamorph *Phoma lingam*) is the causal agent
of blackleg disease on *Brassica* crops. One of the symptoms of this
disease is stem canker leading to major crop losses. The life cycle of
this fungus consists of alternation between a saprohytic phase on plant
residues, a necrotrophic short phase on leaves and a long phase of
endophytism inside the plant tissues. Finally, it eventually kills the
plant with another nectrotrophic phase at the basis of the stem.
