**About *Aspergillus nidulans FGSC A4***
-------------------------
Aspergillus nidulans is one of many species of filamentous fungi in 
the phylum Ascomycota. It has been an important research organism for 
studying eukaryotic cell biology

for over 50 years,

being used to study a wide range of subjects including recombination, 
DNA repair, mutation, cell cycle control, tubulin, chromatin, 
nucleokinesis, pathogenesis, metabolism, and experimental evolution.

It is one of the few species in its genus able to form sexual spores 
through meiosis, allowing crossing of strains in the laboratory. A. 
nidulans is a homothallic fungus, meaning it is able to self-fertilize 
and form fruiting bodies in the absence of a mating partner. It has 
septate hyphae with a woolly colony texture and white mycelia. The 
green colour of wild-type colonies is due to pigmentation of the 
spores, while mutations in the pigmentation pathway can produce other 
spore colours.
