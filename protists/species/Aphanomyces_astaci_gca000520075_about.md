About *Aphanomyces astaci str. APO3* 
------------------------------------

Crayfish plague, *Aphanomyces astaci*, is a water mold that
infects crayfish, most notably the European *Astacus* which dies within
a few weeks of being infected. When experimentally tested, species from
Australia, New Guinea and Japan were also found to be susceptible to the
infection.
