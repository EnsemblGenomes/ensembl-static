**About *Giardia intestinalis***
-------------------------
Giardia duodenalis, also known as *Giardia intestinalis* and Giardia 
lamblia, is a flagellated parasitic protozoan microorganism of the 
genus Giardia that colonizes the small intestine, causing a diarrheal 
condition known as giardiasis. The parasite attaches to the intestinal 
epithelium by a ventral disc, and reproduces via binary fission. G. 
duodenalis is a non-invasive parasite, that does not spread to other 
parts of the gastrointestinal tract, but remains confined to the lumen 
of the small intestine. The parasite exists in two forms; trophozoites 
and cysts. The microorganism can undergo encystation, transforming 
into a dormant cyst that enables it to survive outside of its host. 
Giardia trophozoites are anaerobic, and absorb their nutrients from 
the intestinal lumen. If the organism is stained, its characteristic 
pattern resembles the familiar "smiley face" symbol.
