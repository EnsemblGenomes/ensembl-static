About *Plasmodium berghei* 
--------------------------



***Plasmodium berghei*** is a species in the genus *Plasmodium* subgenus
*Vinckeia*.

It is a protozoan parasite that causes malaria in certain rodents.
Originally, isolated from thicket rats in Central Africa, *P. berghei*
is one of four *Plasmodium* species that have been described in African
murine rodents, the others being *Plasmodium chabaudi*, *Plasmodium
vinckei*, and *Plasmodium yoelii*. Due to its ability to infect rodents
and relative ease of genetic engineering, *P. berghei* is a popular
model organism for the study of human malaria.
