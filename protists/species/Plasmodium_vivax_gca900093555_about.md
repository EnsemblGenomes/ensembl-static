**About *Plasmodium vivax***
-------------------------
*Plasmodium vivax* is a protozoal parasite and a human pathogen. This 
parasite is the most frequent and widely distributed cause of 
recurring malaria. Although it is less virulent than Plasmodium 
falciparum, the deadliest of the five human malaria parasites, P. 
vivax malaria infections can lead to severe disease and death, often 
due to splenomegaly. P. vivax is carried by the female Anopheles 
mosquito; the males do not bite.
