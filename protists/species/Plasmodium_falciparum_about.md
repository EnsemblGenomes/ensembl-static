and the deadliest species of Plasmodium that causes malaria in humans. 
The parasite is transmitted through the bite of a female Anopheles 
mosquito and causes the disease's most dangerous form, falciparum 
malaria. P. falciparum is therefore regarded as the deadliest parasite 
in humans. It is also associated with the development of blood cancer 
and is classified as a Group 2A (probable) carcinogen.
