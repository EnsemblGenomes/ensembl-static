About the *Dictyostelium discoideum* genome 
-------------------------------------------

*Dictyostelium discoideum* belongs to the group dictyostelids. It is a
remarkable protist that can alternate long periods of life as single
cells with stages of participation in multicellular assemblies. These
assemblies display striking similarities with multicellular organisms
including co-ordinated cell movements, differential cell adhesion, cell
type specialization and organization into tissues. *Dictyostelium* is a
popular system to study the evolution of social behaviour and of
developmental strategies.
