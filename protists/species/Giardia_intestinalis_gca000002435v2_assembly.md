### Assembly 

*G. intestinalis* (also known as *G. lamblia*) (ATCC 50803) strain WB, clone C6 genome was sequenced to
11.3 coverage using the whole genome shotgun method. It is 12 Mb in size
and contains 6488 predicted open reading frames distributed throughout
five chromosomes (chromosome polymorphism has been identified in
different strains). Karyotyping studies found chromosome sizes to range from 1.6 to over 3.8 Mb. The assembly presented has been imported from [INSDC](http://www.insdc.org).
