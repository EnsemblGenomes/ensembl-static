About the *Globisporangium ultimum* genome
----------------------------------

*Globisporangium ultimum*, previously known as *Pythium ultimum*, is a ubiquitous oomycete plant pathogen responsible
for a variety of diseases on a broad range of crop and ornamental
species. Analysis of this genome sequence suggests that
not all oomycete plant pathogens contain a similar 'toolkit' for
survival and pathogenesis. *Globisporangium ultimum* has a distinct effector
repertoire compared to Phytophthora spp. The repertoire of metabolic
genes within the *Globisporangium ultimum* genome reflects its pathogenic
lifestyle. It is an opportunistic pathogen of young seedlings and plant
roots with little or no cuticle or heavily suberized tissue, consistent
with lack of cutinase encoding genes. It is a poor competitor against
secondary invaders of damaged plant tissues and soil organisms with
better saprobic ability.
