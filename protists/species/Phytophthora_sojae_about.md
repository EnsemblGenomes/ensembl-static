**About *Phytophthora sojae***
-------------------------
*Phytophthora sojae* is an oomycete and a soil-borne plant pathogen 
that causes stem and root rot of soybean. This is a prevalent disease 
in most soybean growing regions, and a major cause of crop loss. In 
wet conditions the pathogen produces zoospores that move in water and 
are attracted to soybean roots. Zoospores can attach to roots, 
germinate, and infect the plant tissues. Diseased roots develop 
lesions that may spread up the stem and eventually kill the entire 
plant. Phytophthora sojae also produces oospores that can remain 
dormant in the soil over the winter, or longer, and germinate when 
conditions are favourable. Oospores may also be spread by animals or 
machinery.
