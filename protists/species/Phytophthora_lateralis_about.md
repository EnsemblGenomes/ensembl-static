**About *Phytophthora lateralis MPF4***
-------------------------
Phytophthora lateralis is a soil-borne plant pathogen that causes cedar root disease in Port Orford cedars (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana). This pathogen was first noted to cause disease in around 1920 on nursery stock near Seattle.Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) is also vulnerable to P. lateralis but less susceptible than Lawson cypress trees, and tree mortality has only been observed in areas where C. lawsoniana trees were also infected. Asiatic species of Chamaecyparis are generally described as resistant to P. lateralis, although this pathogen is occasionally isolated from Chamaecyparis obtusa (Hinoki cypress) in nurseries.
