### Assembly 

The *Plasmodium falciparum* genome has a total size of 23Mb, organized in 14 chromosomes
and is available from the ENA/Genbank databases under the accession
[GCA_000002765.3](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_000002765.3).

Due to its size and the high AT content, a chromosome-based approach was
chosen for the sequencing strategy. The chromosomes from *P. falciparum* 3D7 were distributed
among the sequencing centers that make up the *P. falciparum* Genome Sequencing
Consortium](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/P_falciparum/who&what.shtml),
established in 1996. The sequencing centers involved in this research
program are [The Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/P_falciparum/), 
The Institute for Genomic Research([TIGR](http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/pfa1/)),
in collaboration with the [US Naval Medical Research Center](http://www.nmrc.navy.mil/), 
and the Stanford Genome Technology Center](http://med.stanford.edu/sgtc/research/malaria.html)
at Stanford University.
