**About *Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1***
-------------------------
Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a diatom, the only species in the genus 
Phaeodactylum. Unlike other diatoms, P. tricornutum can exist in 
different morphotypes and changes in cell shape can be stimulated by 
environmental conditions. This feature can be used to explore the 
molecular basis of cell shape control and morphogenesis. Unlike most 
diatoms, P. tricornutum can grow in the absence of silicon and can 
survive without making silicified frustules. This provides 
opportunities for experimental exploration of silicon-based 
nanofabrication in diatoms.
