About the *Plasmodium vivax* genome
-----------------------------------

*Plasmodium vivax* is one of four species of malarial parasite of humans
transmitted by the *Anopheles* mosquito, and the most common cause of
recurring malaria. Infections are seldom fatal. The genome is 22 MB in
size; the GC content is 45% (unlike some other *Plasmodia* sequences,
which have notably low GC content); and about 5000 genes have been
predicted.
