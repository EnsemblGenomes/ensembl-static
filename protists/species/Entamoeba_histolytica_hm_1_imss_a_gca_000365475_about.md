About *Entamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS-A* 
-----------------------------------------



***Entamoeba histolytica*** is an anaerobic parasitic amoebozoan, part
of the genus *Entamoeba*. Predominantly infecting humans and other
primates causing amoebiasis, *E. histolytica* is estimated to infect
about 50 million people worldwide. *E. histolytica* infection is
estimated to kill more than 55,000 people each year. Previously, it was
thought that 10% of the world population was infected, but these figures
predate the recognition that at least 90% of these infections were due
to a second species, *E. dispar*. Mammals such as dogs and cats can
become infected transiently, but are not thought to contribute
significantly to transmission.

The word *histolysis* literally means disintegration and dissolution of
organic tissues.
