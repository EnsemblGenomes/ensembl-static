**About *Albugo laibachii***
-------------------------
* (*Albugo laibachii*)* is a species of oomycete, whose genome has 
recently (2011) been sequenced. It is a plant pathogen of Arabidopsis 
thaliana. Albugo laibachii also causes the host plant to become more 
susceptible to other parasites, when it normally would be more 
resistant, wearing down the host plant's immune system.
