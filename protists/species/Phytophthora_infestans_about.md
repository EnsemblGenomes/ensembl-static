About the *Phytophtora infestans* genome
----------------------------------------

*Phytophthora infestans* is the causal agent of the late potato blight
disease and also infects tomatoes and other members of the Solanaceae.
This oomycete caused several major crop losses including the Great
Famine in Ireland. This pathogen can affect a large area reproducing
asexually through spores. *P. infestans* sporangia are carried by the
wind until they land in plant tissue. If the conditions are wet and cool
they release their zoospores that can swim until encysting in the host.
If conditions are warmer a germ tube from the sporangium can penetrate
the plant.
