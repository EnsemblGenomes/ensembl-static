***Theileria parva*** is a parasitic protozoan, named in honour of
Arnold Theiler, that causes East Coast fever (theileriosis) in cattle, a
costly disease in Africa. The main vector for *T. parva* is the tick
*Rhipicephalus appendiculatus*. Theiler found that East Coast fever was
not the same as redwater, but caused by a different protozoan.
