About the *Tetrahymena thermophila* genome
------------------------------------------

The ciliate *Tetrahymena thermophila* is a model organism for molecular
and cellular biology. Like other ciliates, this species has separate
germline and soma functions that are embodied by distinct nuclei within
a single cell. The germline-like micronucleus (MIC) has its genome held
in reserve for sexual reproduction. The soma-like macronucleus (MAC),
which possesses a genome processed from that of the MIC, is the center
of gene expression and does not directly contribute DNA to sexual
progeny.
