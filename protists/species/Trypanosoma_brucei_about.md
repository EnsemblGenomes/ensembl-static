**About *Trypanosoma brucei***
-------------------------
*Trypanosoma brucei* is a species of parasitic kinetoplastid belonging 
to the genus Trypanosoma that is present in sub-Saharan Africa. Unlike 
other protozoan parasites that normally infect blood and tissue cells, 
it is exclusively extracellular and inhabits the blood plasma and body 
fluids. It causes deadly vector-borne diseases: African 
trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness in humans, and animal 
trypanosomiasis or nagana in cattle and horses. It is a species 
complex grouped into three subspecies: T. b. brucei, T. b. gambiense 
and T. b. rhodesiense. The first is a parasite of non-human mammals 
and causes nagana, while the latter two are zoonotic infecting both 
humans and animals and cause African trypanosomiasis.
