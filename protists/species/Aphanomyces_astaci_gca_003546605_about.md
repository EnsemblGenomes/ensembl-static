**About *Aphanomyces astaci***
-------------------------
Crayfish plague is a water mold that infects crayfish, most notably 
the European Astacus which dies within a few weeks of being infected. 
When experimentally tested, species from Australia, New Guinea and 
Japan were also found to be susceptible to the infection.
