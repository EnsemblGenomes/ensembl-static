About *Phytophthora kernoviae* 
------------------------------



***Phytophthora kernoviae*** is a plant pathogen that mainly infects
European beech (*Fagus sylvatica*) and *Rhododendron ponticum*. It was
first identified in 2003 in Cornwall, UK when scientists were surveying
for the presence of *Phytophthora ramorum*. This made it the third new
*Phytophthora* species to be found in the UK in a decade. Since then
many other plants have been identified as natural hosts of the pathogen.
Molecular analysis has revealed that an infection on *Pinus radiata*,
recorded in New Zealand in 1950, was caused by *P. kernoviae*.
