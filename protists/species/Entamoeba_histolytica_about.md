**About *Entamoeba histolytica***
-------------------------
*Entamoeba histolytica* is an anaerobic parasitic amoebozoan, part of 
the genus Entamoeba. Predominantly infecting humans and other primates 
causing amoebiasis, E. histolytica is estimated to infect about 35-50 
million people worldwide. E. histolytica infection is estimated to 
kill more than 55,000 people each year. Previously, it was thought 
that 10% of the world population was infected, but these figures 
predate the recognition that at least 90% of these infections were due 
to a second species, E. dispar. Mammals such as dogs and cats can 
become infected transiently, but are not thought to contribute 
significantly to transmission.
