About the *Entamoeba histolytica* genome
----------------------------------------

*Entamoeba histolytica* is an anaerobic parasitic protozoan, part of the
genus *Entamoeba*. Predominantly infecting humans and other primates,
*E. histolytica* is estimated to infect about 50 million people
worldwide. *Entamoeba histolytica* (strain HM-1:IMSS), was the first
human amoeba to have its genome sequenced, assembled and analyzed. Whole
genome shotgun sequencing with small insert libraries was used to carry
out sequencing to a 12.5-fold coverage.
