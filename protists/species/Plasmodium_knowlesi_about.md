About the *Plasmodium\_knowlesi* genome
---------------------------------------

*Plasmodium knowlesi* is a parasite of primates, especially long-tailed
macaques. Its genome contains a large gene family that
mimics regulators of the human immune system, while genes involved in
antigenic variation (used to variably coat paratisized red blood cells
to confuse the host defence system) are clustered on the tips of
chromosomes, unlike other species of *Plasmodia*. The genome is around 2.3 Mb and the GC content is around 40%.
