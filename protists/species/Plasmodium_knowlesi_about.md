**About *Plasmodium knowlesi***
-------------------------
*Plasmodium knowlesi* is a parasite that causes malaria in humans and 
other primates. It is found throughout Southeast Asia, and is the most 
common cause of human malaria in Malaysia. Like other Plasmodium 
species, P. knowlesi has a life cycle that requires infection of both 
a mosquito and a warm-blooded host. While the natural warm-blooded 
hosts of P. knowlesi are likely various Old World monkeys, humans can 
be infected by P. knowlesi if they are fed upon by infected 
mosquitoes. P. knowlesi is a eukaryote in the phylum Apicomplexa, 
genus Plasmodium, and subgenus Plasmodium. It is most closely related 
to the human parasite Plasmodium vivax as well as other Plasmodium 
species that infect non-human primates.
