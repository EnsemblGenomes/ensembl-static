About the *Plasmodium\_knowlesi* genome
---------------------------------------

*Plasmodium knowlesi* is a parasite of primates, especially long-tailed
macaques. It\'s genome contains a large gene family that apparently
mimics regulators of the human immune system, while genes involved in
antigenic variation (used to variably coat paratisized red blood cells
to confuse the host defence system) are clustered on the tips of
chromosomes, unlike other species of *Plasmodia*. The size of the genome
is 2.3 Mb, GC content is around 40%, and the gene count is approximately
5000; this are similar values to those of the *Plasmodium vivax* genome,
but different from the genome of *Plasmodium falciparum* which has a
lower GC content; while more genes have been predicted in *Plasmodium
yoelli yoelii*.
