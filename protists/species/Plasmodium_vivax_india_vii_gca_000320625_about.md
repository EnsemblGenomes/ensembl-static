About *Plasmodium vivax India VII* 
----------------------------------



***Plasmodium vivax*** is a protozoal parasite and a human pathogen.
This parasite is the most frequent and widely distributed cause of
recurring (Benign tertian) malaria, *P. vivax* is one of the five
species of malaria parasites that commonly infect humans. Although it is
less virulent than *Plasmodium falciparum*, the deadliest of the five
human malaria parasites, *P. vivax* malaria infections can lead to
severe disease and death, often due to splenomegaly (a pathologically
enlarged spleen). *P. vivax* is carried by the female *Anopheles*
mosquito; the males do not bite.
