About *Plasmodium falciparum NF135/5.C10* 
-----------------------------------------



***Plasmodium falciparum*** is a protozoan parasite, one of the species
of *Plasmodium* that cause malaria in humans. It is transmitted by the
female *Anopheles* mosquito. This species causes the disease\'s most
dangerous form, malignant Rates of infection decreased from 2000 to 2015
by 37%, but increased from 2014\'s 198 million cases. In sub-Saharan
Africa, over 75% of cases were due to *P. falciparum*, whereas in most
other malarial countries, other, less virulent plasmodial species
predominate. Almost every malarial death is caused by *P. falciparum*.

Of the six malarial parasites, *P. falciparum* causes the most-often
fatal and medically severe form of disease. Malaria is prevalent in
tropical countries with an incidence of 300 million per year and
mortality of 1 to 2 million per year. Roughly 50% of all malarial
infections are caused by *P. falciparum*.
