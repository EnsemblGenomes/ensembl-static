**About *Spironucleus salmonicida***
-------------------------
*Spironucleus salmonicida* is a species of fish parasite. It is a 
flagellate adapted to micro-aerobic environments that causes systemic 
infections in salmonid fish. The species creates foul-smelling, 
pus-filled abscesses in muscles and internal organs of aquarium fish. 
In the late 1980s when the disease was first reported, it was believed 
to be caused by Spironucleus barkhanus. Anders J�rgensen was the 
person that found out what species really caused the disease.
