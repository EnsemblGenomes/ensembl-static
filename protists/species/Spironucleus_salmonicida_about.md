**About *Spironucleus salmonicida***
-------------------------
*Spironucleus salmonicida* is a species of fish parasite. It is a 
flagellate adapted to micro-aerobic environments that causes systemic 
infections in salmonid fish. The species creates foul-smelling, 
pus-filled abscesses in muscles and internal organs of aquarium fish. 
In the late 1980s when the disease was first reported, it was believed 
to be caused by Spironucleus barkhanus. Anders Jorgensen was the 
person that found out what species really caused the disease.
