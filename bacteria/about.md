## Ensembl Bacteria

Ensembl Bacteria is a browser for bacterial and archaeal genomes. The assemblies for these are taken from the databases of the [International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration](http://www.insdc.org/), the European Nucleotide Archive at the EBI, GenBank at the NCBI, and the DNA Database of Japan).

### Data access

Data can be visualised through the Ensembl genome browser and accessed programmatically via our Perl and RESTful APIs. Data is also accessible through public MySQL databases and our FTP site containing full data dumps in FASTA, EMBL, GTF, GFF3, JSON and RDF formats. A selection of over 100 key bacterial genomes have been included in the pan-taxonomic compara, and genes from all genomes have been classified into families using HAMAP and PANTHER [more details](/info/docs/compara/index.html).
