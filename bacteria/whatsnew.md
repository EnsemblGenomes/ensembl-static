New and updated genomes:
A total of 31,332 bacterial and archaeal genomes
22088 new genomes including Synergistetes bacterium, a bacteria present in the human gastrointestinal microbiota which are typically absent from healthy individuals in the developed world and 16 new strains of Prevotella copri, intestinal anaerobic bacteria correlated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis.

Renamed genomes:
567 genomes have been renamed in the NCBI taxonomy database since our last update
In particular, 6 species that used to be in pan-taxonomic compara have been renamed
 
Removed genomes:
34804 genomes have been removed (mostly due to them being marked as redundant by UniProt)
In particular, 15 species that used to be in pan-taxonomic compara are now removed
 
Updated data:
Annotation of pathogen-host interaction data (PHI-base version 4-8_2019-09-16)
Alignments to Rfam covariance models (Rfam 12.2) visible in new track (‘Rfam models’)
Updated protein features for all species using InterProScan with version 2015_04 of InterPro
Bacterial species names used within our production processes now have the assembly accession as a suffix (e.g. streptococcus_pneumoniae_tigr4 is now named streptococcus_pneumoniae_tigr4_gca_000006885). Please amend any stored bookmarks for species pages.
