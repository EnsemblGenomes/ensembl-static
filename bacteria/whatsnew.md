In June 2023, Ensembl Bacteria released new gene models generated using Prokka for the non-redundant bacterial genomes it contains. The details of the non redundancy criteria set out by UniProt and how we have used them are described in our [blog](https://www.ensembl.info/2020/09/21/ensembl-bacteria-updates/). 

- Genomes

	- A total of 31,332 bacterial and archaeal genomes

- Data 

	-New gene models predicted by Prokka for 31,217 of the genomes 
        -Updated annotation of molecular interactions involving bacterial genes 
	- Alignments to [Rfam](https://rfam.xfam.org) covariance models (Rfam 12.2) visible in separate track (‘Rfam models’)
	- Updated protein features for all species using [InterProScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/)
	- Updated pan-taxonomic compara (which includes key bacterial species)
