Release 50 of Ensembl Bacteria has no major updates since the previous release. As for release 49, we only represent non-redundant bacterial genomes as defined by criteria set out by UniProt. See more details about this update in our [blog](https://www.ensembl.info/2020/09/21/ensembl-bacteria-updates/). 

- Genomes

	- A total of 31,332 bacterial and archaeal genomes

- Data 

	- Annotation of pathogen-host interaction data ([PHI-base](http://www.phi-base.org/index.jsp) version 2019-09-16
	- Alignments to [Rfam](https://rfam.xfam.org) covariance models (Rfam 12.2) visible in separate track (‘Rfam models’)
	- Updated protein features for all species using [InterProScan](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/) version 81
	- Updated pan-taxonomic compara (which includes key bacterial species)
	- Bacterial species names used within our production processes now have the assembly accession as a suffix (e.g. streptococcus_pneumoniae_tigr4 is now named streptococcus_pneumoniae_tigr4_gca_000006885). Please amend any stored bookmarks for species pages.
