### Variation
Variation data from the European Variation Archive was [added](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?eva-study=PRJEB18671).

The data is from a project conducted to investigate selection signatures in soybean subgroups. 112 Glycine soja and 133 Glycine max accessions were re-sequenced, and numerous variants for the 245 accessions were obtained through variant calling process using GATK. Then, to avoid as false-positive variants as much possible, variant-quality-filtering and allele-frequency-filtering processes were conducted to the obtained variants. Finally, 9,650,073 bi-allelic SNP variants with minor allele frequency > 1% were identified for the 245 soybean accessions and utilized to this project [3].
