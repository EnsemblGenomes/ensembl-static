### Annotation

RNA sequencing of seven tissues (leaf, petal, stamen, capsule, stem, fine root, tap root) was carried out. Transcripts were annotated with an in-house pipeline chaining Hisat2, Stringtie and Ballgown. In addition, Trinity was used for de novo transcriptome assembly and generated EST evidence for gene prediction. Gene models were predicted using the MAKER pipeline. The BUSCO test reported 95.3% of complete gene models (38% single-copy and 62% duplicated genes) plus 1.4% additional fragmented models. 

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html).There are: 785658 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 23 Mb (0.8% of the genome); 193205 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 65 Mb (2.4% of the genome); 367896 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 60 Mb (2.2% of the genome).
