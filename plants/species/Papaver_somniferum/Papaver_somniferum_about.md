About *Papaver somniferum*
--------------------------

The opium poppy (*Papaver somniferum*) is a diploid (2n=22) of the *Papaveraceae* family.
The sap, known as opium, contains various alkaloids, including morphine and codeine, with effects ranging from pain relief and cough suppression to euphoria, sleepiness, and addiction. It has been a source of painkillers since the Neolithic. Opium poppy remains the only commercially viable source of the morphinan subclass of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. This is the genome of cultivar High Noscapine 1 (HN1).
