### Assembly

After two cycles of self-pollination, one HN1 plant was selected to prepare DNA from leaves for  Illumina  paired-end  and  mate-pair  sequencing (214x). Subsequently, this plant was self-pollinated and its progeny grown to obtain fine leaf material for Ultra High Molecular Weight grade and Next Generation Sequencing grade DNA preparations. This DNA was used for 10X Genomics (40x) and  Single Molecule Real-Time PacBio sequencing (66.8x). The genome size was estimated to be 2.87Gb based on 61-mer frequency. The genome assembly was conducted using DeNovoMAGIC from NRGene, yielding a highly contiguous 2.73Gb assembly with scaffold N50 at 15.6Mb and contig N50 at 121kb. Overall, 81.6% of sequences were assigned into individual chromosomes using a linkage map generated by sequence-based genotyping of 84 F2 plants.
