### Assembly

*Aegilops umbellulata* assembly TA1851 is created by the [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/)(King Abdullah University of Science and Technology). This chromosome-scale assembly is sequenced using PacBio Sequel and HiFi reads were then assembled using [La Jolla Assembler](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01220-6) (LJA) and [DeepConsensus] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01435-7). The genome assembly resulted in seven pseudomolecules and one unanchored chromosome with a total size of 4.25 Gb with a contig N50 of 17.7 Mb.
