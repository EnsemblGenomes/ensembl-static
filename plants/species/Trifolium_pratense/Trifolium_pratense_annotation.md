### Annotation

The genome was annotated by [De Vega, JJ, *et
al*.](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26617401). Repeats were masked
using RepeatMasker with the RepBase database, LTRharvest38. Transcripts
were annotated using RNA-seq data with *ab initio* predictions and
homologous transcripts from soybean, common bean, and *M. truncatula*.

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 91429549 - Repeats content: 30%
