### Assembly

The assembly is created by the [FBGC](https://projects.au.dk/fabagenome/genomics-data) (Faba Bean Genome Consortium). The 13-Gb faba bean genome (2n = 2x = 12) is one of the largest diploid field crops. The genome was sequenced with PacBio HiFi long reads to 20-fold coverage and assembled 11.9 Gb of sequence, more than half of which was represented by contigs longer than 2.7 Mb. The inbred line ‘Hedin/2’ was choosen as a reference genotype owing to its high autofertility and productivity, combined with an early maturing spring habit and exceptional degree of homozygosity. Linkage information afforded by a genetic map and chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) data placed 11.2 Gb (94%) into chromosomal pseudomolecules. The biggest of its six chromosomes holds the equivalent of an entire human genome and its dominant repeat family members are longer (up to 25 kb) than those in similarly sized polyploid cereal genomes.
