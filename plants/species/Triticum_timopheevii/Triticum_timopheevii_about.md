**About *Triticum timopheevii***
-------------------------
*Triticum timopheevii*, Timopheev's wheat or Zanduri wheat, is a tetraploid wheat that has both cultivated and wild forms. It is believed to have evolved in isolation from the more common Triticum turgidum; hybrids between T. timopheevii and T. turgidum are reportedly sterile with "a considerable amount of chromosomal irregularities in meiosis."
