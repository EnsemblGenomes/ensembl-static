### Annotation

Gene annotation was provided by [valleyoak.ucla.edu](https://valleyoak.ucla.edu).
More details will be posted upon publication of the paper describing this assembly.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature
pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). 
There are: 2,312,761 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 74 Mb 
(8.8% of the genome); 231,802 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants 
library), covering 87 Mb (10.2% of the genome); 752,294 Tandem repeats 
(TRF) features, covering 99 Mb (11.6% of the genome).
