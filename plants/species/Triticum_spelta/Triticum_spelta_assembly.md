### Assembly
The genome assembly was constructed using the DeNovoMAGIC3.0 assembly pipeline, previously used for the wild emmer wheat [2], durum wheat [3] and Chinese Spring RefSeqv1.0 assemblies [1]. Briefly, high-molecular-weight DNA was extracted from wheat seedlings. Illumina 450-bp paired-end (PE), 800-bp PE and mate-pair (MP) libraries of three different sizes (3 kb, 6 kb and 9 kb) were generated. Sequencing was performed at the University of Illinois Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center. 10X Genomics Chromium genome libraries were prepared and sequenced at the Genome Canada Genome Innovation Centre using the manufacturersâ€™ recommendations to achieve a minimum of 30 coverage. Hi-C libraries were prepared. Using the Illumina PE, MP, 10X Genomics Chromium, and Hi-C, chromosome scale assemblies were prepared.
