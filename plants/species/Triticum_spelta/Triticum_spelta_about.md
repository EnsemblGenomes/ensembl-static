About *Triticum spelta*
-------------------------

*Triticum spelta* (Spelt) was an important staple food in parts of Europe from the Bronze Age to medieval times. Now it survives as a relict crop in Central Europe and northern Spain, and has also found a new market as a health food. Spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related species common wheat (Triticum aestivum).
