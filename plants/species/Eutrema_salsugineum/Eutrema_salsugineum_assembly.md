### Assembly

A high-quality genome sequence of *E. salsugineum* at 8x coverage using a traditional Sanger sequencing-based whole-genome shotgun approach was obtained. This was based on a BAC library with read length ranging from 500 to 1000 bp. A total of 3,875,327 sequence reads were assembled using a modified version of Arachne to form 1,107 scaffolds (4,292 contigs) with a scaffold L50 of 9.2 Mb, in total of 245.8 Mb of sequences. 

The scaffolds were screened against bacterial proteins, organelle sequences, and GenBank non-redundant database to remove potential contamination. Additional scaffolds were removed if they consisted of >95% 24-mers that occurred four other times in scaffolds larger than 50 kb. To improve assembly contiguity, the 1,107 scaffolds were further joined using a combination of *A. thaliana* synteny and BAC and fosmid pair support. The final release contains 639 scaffolds (243.1 Mb).
