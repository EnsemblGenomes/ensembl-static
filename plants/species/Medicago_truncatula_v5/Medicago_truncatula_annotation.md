### Annotation

Gene models were predicted by the plant genome annotation pipeline [egn-ep](http://eugene.toulouse.inra.fr/) release 1.4. Four protein databases were aligned with blastx to detect the translated regions: TAIR10, Swiss-Prot (October 2016), a plant subset of Uniprot proteins (October 2016) and the proteome of Brachypodium distachyon release 192. Non-coding RNA genes were detected based on the transcriptomic data performed by EuGene and also predicted by tRNAScan-SE, RNAMMER and infernal 1.1.2. Finally, 44,623 protein-coding genes, 974 tRNAs, 62 rRNAs and 5,657 lncRNAs were annotated in the [release 1.6](https://medicago.toulouse.inra.fr/MtrunA17r5.0-ANR/) with 24,645 full-length transposable elements. A putative function was assigned to 31,362 proteins and 13,261 proteins were tagged as ‘hypothetical proteins’.
