### Annotation

The completeness of the assembly was estimated using 1,007,962 ESTs from BRASUZ1, finding that 98.98% of available expressed gene loci were included in the 11 chromosome assemblies.
To produce the gene set the homology-based FgenesH and GenomeScan were used. The best gene prediction at each locus was selected and integrated with EST assemblies using PASA.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html).There are: 1104174 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 73 Mb (10.5% of the genome); 276345 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 95 Mb (13.7% of the genome); 410973 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 34 Mb (4.9% of the genome).
