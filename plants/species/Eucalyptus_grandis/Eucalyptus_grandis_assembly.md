### Assembly

Sequencing reads were collected with standard Sanger sequencing protocols 
on ABI 3730XL automated sequencers at the Joint Genome Institute, USA. 
Three different sized libraries were used for the plasmid subclone sequencing 
process and paired-end sequencing. A total of 3,446,208 reads from the 2.6-kb 
sized libraries, 3,479,232 reads from the 6.0-kb sized libraries and 518,016 reads 
from a 36.2–40.6-kb library were sequenced. Two BAC libraries (EG_Ba, 127.5-kb insert and EG_Bb, 155.0-kb insert) were end sequenced to add an additional 294,912 reads for long-range linking.

The sequence reads were assembled using a modified version of Arachne v.20071016.
The resulting output was then passed through Rebuilder and SquashOverlaps subsequently 
run through another complete Arachne assembly process to finalize the assembly. This produced 6,043 scaffold sequences, with a scaffold L50 of 4.9 Mb and total scaffold size of 692.7 Mb. 
For chromosome-scale pseudomolecule construction, markers from a genetic map were placed 
and a total of 19 breaks made based on linkage group discontiguity. A subset of the broken 
scaffolds were combined using 257 joins to form the 11 pseudomolecule chromosomes, which contained 605.9 Mb out of 691.3 Mb (88%) of the assembled sequence. The final assembly contains 4,952 scaffolds with a contig L50 of 67.2 kb and a scaffold L50 of 53.9 Mb.
