About *Eucalyptus grandis*.
--------------------------

*Eucalyptus grandis* is a diploid (2n = 2x = 22) naturally found
in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Eucalypts are the worldâ€™s 
most widely planted hardwood trees. They are predominantly outcrossers 
with hermaphroditic animal-pollinated flowers, and thus highly heterozygous.
This genome corresponds to BRASUZ1, a S1 individual (one generation of selfing) of 
an elite tree originally derived from seed lots collected in Coffs Harbor 
(Australia).
