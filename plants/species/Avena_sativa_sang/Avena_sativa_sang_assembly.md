### Assembly
We produced a chromosome-scale reference sequence of oat cv. ‘Sang’ comprising 21 pseudochromosomes, with a BUSCO score of 98.7%, following the short-read strategy used for wheat, barley and rye. Inspection of Hi-C contact matrices and the consensus genetic map and their comparison with the independent assembly (long-read) of hexaploid oat OT3098 verified the integrity of the assembly.
