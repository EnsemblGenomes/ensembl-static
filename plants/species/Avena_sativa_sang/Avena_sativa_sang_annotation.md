### Annotation
Gene models were predicted in the oat genome using an automated annotation pipeline, assisted by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and Iso-seq transcriptome data, protein homology and ab initio prediction. This yielded 80,608 high-confidence protein-coding loci (98.5% BUSCO), 83.5% of which showed evidence of transcription in at least one condition. Another 71,727 low-confidence protein-coding loci primarily represent gene fragments, pseudogenes and gene models with weak support. The overall amount and composition of transposable elements is very similar between the Sang and OT3098 assemblies.
