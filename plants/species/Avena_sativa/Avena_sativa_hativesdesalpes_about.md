**About *Avena sativa HativesdesAlpes***
-------------------------
The oat, sometimes called the common oat, is a species of cereal grass 
grown for fodder and for its seed, which is known by the same name. 
Oats appear to have been domesticated as a secondary crop, as their 
seeds resembled those of other cereals closely enough for them to be 
included by early cultivators. Oats tolerate cold winters less well 
than cereals such as wheat, barley, and rye, but need less summer heat 
and more rain, making them important in areas such as Northwest Europe 
that have cool, wet summers. They can tolerate low-nutrient and acid 
soils. Oats grow thickly and vigorously, allowing them to outcompete 
many weeds, and compared to other cereals are relatively free from 
diseases.
