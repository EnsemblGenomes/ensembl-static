Ensembl-plants displaying genes imported from the community GFF3 linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_949783355.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_949783355.1).

Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by ["Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research"](https://www.ipk-gatersleben.de/en/).

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [Ensembl-plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
