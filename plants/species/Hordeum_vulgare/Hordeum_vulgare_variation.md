### Variation

The following variation datasets were remapped from assembly IBSC_v2 to MorexV3:

1.  [Variation data from WGS survey sequencing of four
    cultivars](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23075845), Barke,
    Bowman, Igri, Haruna Nijo and a wild barley (H. spontaneum)\].
2.  [SNPs discovered from
    RNA-seq](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23075845) performed on
    the embryo tissues of nine spring barley varieties (Barke, Betzes,
    Bowman, Derkado, Intro, Optic, Quench, Sergeant and Tocada) and
    Morex using Illumina HiSeq 2000.
3.  Approximately five million variations from [population sequencing of
    90 Morex x Barke
    individuals](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24243933).
4.  Approximately six million variations from [population sequencing of
    84 Oregon Wolfe barley
    individuals](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24243933).
5.  SNPs from the [Illumina iSelect 9k barley SNP
    chip](https://bioinf.hutton.ac.uk/iselect/app/index.pl). \~2,600
    mapped [genetic markers associated with these
    SNPs](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23998490) are also
    displayed.
