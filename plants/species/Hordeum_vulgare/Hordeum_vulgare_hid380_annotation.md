Ensembl-plants displaying genes imported from the community GFF3 linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_951341805.1](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_951341805.1).

Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by ["Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg"](https://www.uni-halle.de/?lang=en).

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [Ensembl-plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
