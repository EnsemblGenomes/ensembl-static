About *Solanum tuberosum*
-------------------------

*Solanum tuberosum* (potato) is the worlds fourth most important food
crop after rice, wheat and maize. Potatoes were first introduced outside
the Andes four centuries ago, and it is estimated that by the year 2020
over two billion people will depend on it for food, feed, or income. 
It belongs to the *Solanaceae*, a diverse family of agriculturally important
species, including tomato, eggplant, pepper, tobacco, and petunia.
The potato genome consists of 12 chromosomes and has a (haploid) length of
approximately 840 Mb, making it a medium-sized plant genome.
While many potato lines are tetraploid, this sequenced accession corresponds to
homozygous diploid line (double haploid) *S. tuberosum phureja* DM1-3 516 R44.
