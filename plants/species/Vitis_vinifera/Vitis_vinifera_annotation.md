**Annotation**
----------

The annotation presented is derived from annotation submitted to
[INSDC](http://www.insdc.org) with the assembly accession [GCA\_030704535.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_030704535.1).

The annotation presented is derived from genes imported from the community GFF3 with the assembly accession GCA_030704535.1.

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [Ensembl-plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).

Repeated sequences were called with the Repeat Detector, which is part of the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipelines](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html). Repeats length: 210570901 - Repeats content: 42.5505%
