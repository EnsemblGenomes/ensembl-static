### Annotation

The teff genome was annotated using the MAKER pipeline. Transcript support from a large-scale expression atlas and protein homology to Arabidopsis and other grass genomes were used as evidence for ab initio gene prediction. After filtering transposon-derived sequences, ab initio gene prediction identified 68,255 gene models.
