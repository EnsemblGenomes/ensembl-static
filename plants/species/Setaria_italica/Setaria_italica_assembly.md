### Assembly

*Setaria italica* cv. Yugu1 was sequenced and assembled by the [Joint
Genome Institute (JGI)](https://www.jgi.doe.gov/) in collaboration with
community researchers. Sanger sequencing was performed on whole-genome
shotgun clone libraries having different insert sizes. Reads totalling
8.29x coverage were assembled with
[Arachne](https://seqanswers.com/wiki/Arachne) giving scaffolds that were
arranged predominantly into nine pseudomolecules.
