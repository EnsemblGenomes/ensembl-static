**About *Avena byzantina PI258586***
-------------------------
*Avena byzantina*, red oats, is a species of cultivated oat in the 
family Poaceae. It is native to Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, the 
Transcaucasus, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Cultivated for thousands of 
years, it is better suited to warmer conditions than white or common 
oats, but is often sown as a no‑till winter crop. There are 564 
landraces and 203 cultivars of red oats listed in the European Plant 
Genetic Resources Search Catalogue (EURISCO). Approximately 10% of the 
millions of hectares worldwide under oats are devoted to red oats, 
principally for fodder.
