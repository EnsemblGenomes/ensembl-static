### Annotation

RNA-Seq reads of vegetative shoot, reproductive spear tip tissue and root tissue were individually aligned to the genome using TopHat2 and processed with Cufflinks. In addition, de novo and genome-guided RNA-Seq assembly was performed using Trinity. These transcriptomes were integrated with PASA. In addition, the Augustus ab initio gene finder was used to identify gene models after training on the PASA database. To leverage annotations from additional genomes to provide additional evidence for gene models, protein models from five plant species were aligned using Exonerate. Evidence from RNA Seq, ab initio and homology-based approaches was combined with Evidence Modeler in order to produce the final gene set.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html).There are: 1496184 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 90 Mb (7.6% of the genome); 384068 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 164 Mb (13.8% of the genome); 1013371 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 137 Mb (11.5% of the genome).
