### Assembly

The 445 Mb chromosome-level assembly of this cacao genome has scaffolds
anchored and oriented to ten chromosomes with BAC end sequencing and
FISH karyotyping-based chromosome assignment, for 94.6% of total
assembly, with 4.4% gap sequence, and the remainder in unlinked
scaffolds. This assembly is primarily composed of Roche 454 Titanium STD
reads, augmented by six recombination paired Titanium libraries, three
fosmid packaged Sanger sequenced libraries, and three Sanger sequenced
BAC Ends libraries. This genome assembly was produced by the [Cacao
Genome Consortium](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23731509).
