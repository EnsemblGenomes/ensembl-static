### Annotation

[Gene models were predicted](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/30115783)
with two independent pipelines previously utilised for wheat genome
annotation and then consolidated to produce the RefSeq Annotation v1.0.
Subsequently, a set of manually curated gene models was integrated to
build RefSeq Annotation v1.1. In total, 107,891 high-confidence (HC)
protein-coding loci were identified, with relatively equal distribution
across the A, B, and D subgenomes. In addition, 161,537 other
protein-coding loci were classified as low-confidence (LC) genes,
representing partially supported gene models, gene fragments, and
orphans. A predicted function was assigned to 82.1% (90,919) of HC genes
in RefSeq Annotation v1.0 (tables S19 and S20), and evidence for
transcription was found for 85% (94,114) of the HC genes versus 49% of
the LC genes [1].

98,270 high confidence genes from the 
[TGACv1 annotation](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28420692) were aligned to
the assembly using
[Exonerate](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/vertebrate-genomics/software/exonerate).
For each gene up to three alignments are displayed, compromising 196,243
alignments of which 90,686 are protein coding.

Each high confidence coding gene is externally linked to
[KnetMiner](https://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk/KnetMiner) [7] and
[WheatExpression](http://www.wheat-expression.com) [8,9].
