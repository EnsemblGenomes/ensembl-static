About *Triticum aestivum*
-------------------------

*Triticum aestivum* (bread wheat) is a major global cereal grain
essential to human nutrition. Wheat was one of the first cereals to be
domesticated, originating in the [fertile
crescent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent) around 7000
years ago. Bread wheat is hexaploid, with a genome size estimated at
~17 Gb, composed of three closely-related and independently maintained
genomes that are the result of a series of naturally occurring
hybridisation events. The ancestral progenitor genomes are considered to
be [*Triticum
urartu*](/Triticum_urartu "Triticum urartu in Ensembl Plants") (the
A-genome donor) and an unknown grass thought to be related to *Aegilops
speltoides* (the B-genome donor). This first hybridisation event
produced tetraploid [emmer
wheat](http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_dicoccoides) (AABB, *T.
dicoccoides*) which hybridized again with *[Aegilops
tauschii](/Aegilops_tauschii "Aegilops tauschii in Ensembl Plants")*
(the D-genome donor) to produce modern bread wheat.

Guidelines for gene nomenclature in wheat can be found in the 2013 edition of the Wheat Gene Catalogue available in [GrainGenes](https://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG3/wgc). The Wheat Gene Catalogue is the internationally agreed rules of nomenclature for wheat genes.
