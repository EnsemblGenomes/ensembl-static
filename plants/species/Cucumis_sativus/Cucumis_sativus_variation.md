A monogenic locus was mapped for resistance to CVYV in cucumber by using a Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) strategy coupled with whole-genome resequencing. 135 F3 families from a segregating population between a pickling susceptible cucumber and a long Dutch type resistant cucumber were phenotyped for CVYV resistance.[4]
