**Annotation**
----------

The annotation presented is derived from genes imported from the community GFF3 with the assembly accession [GCA\_964186695.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_964186695.1). Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by ["John Innes Centre"](https://www.jic.ac.uk/).

The JI2822 genome annotation includes repeat annotation, as detailed in the supplementary materials of Rayner et al. (2024) [1]. A suite of fast neutron (FN) mutants derived from JI2822 was developed and sequenced to identify mutations driving significant variation in seed proteome and predicted seed quality. This analysis was based on sequencing a quintuple mutant in reference to the parental JI2822 genome.

Supporting this work, mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE repository. The dataset identifiers are:
- PXD048561 (TMT labelling)
- PXD048566 (iTRAQ labelling)

These datasets provide a proteomic characterisation of seed quality traits in the JI2822 mutant population.

Protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been computed by [Ensembl Plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
