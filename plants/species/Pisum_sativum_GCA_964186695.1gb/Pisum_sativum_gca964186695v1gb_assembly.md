**Assembly**
--------

The assembly presented here has been imported from [INSDC](http://www.insdc.org) and is linked to the assembly accession [[GCA\_964186695.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_964186695.1)].The total length and structure of the assembly are supported by raw data available under Study ID [PRJEB75659](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB75659) at EMBL-EBI. Additional associated genome data have been deposited in the [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12755082). Chromosomes are oriented according to cytogenetic convention, with the short arm uppermost, as noted in a supplementary file of Rayner et al. (2024).

The total length of the assembly is 3842015444 bp contained within 170 scaffolds. The scaffold N50 value is 535013209, the scaffold L50 value is 4. The GC% content of the assembly is 38.0%.
