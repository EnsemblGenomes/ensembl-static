### Assembly

The genome of *Oryza brachyantha* was sequenced and assembled in the
laboratory of [Dr. Mingsheng
Chen](https://sourcedb.cas.cn/sourcedb_genetics_cas/yw/zjrc/pgr/200907/t20090721_2130990.html)
at the [Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology
(IGDB)](https://english.genetics.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of
Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/), Beijing, China. A whole genome
shotgun sequencing approach was used to generate \~ 104X coverage using
the Illumina GA II platform. The genome was initially assembled using
[SOAPdenovo](https://seqanswers.com/wiki/SOAPdenovo) at
[BGI-Shenzhen](https://www.genomics.cn/en/index), followed by integration
with BAC-end sequences generated at the [Arizona Genomics Institute
(AGI)](https://www.genome.arizona.edu/). The final assembled sequence was
261 Mb with a scaffold N50 size of 1.6 Mb.

Ordering of the scaffolds into twelve pseudomolecules was accomplished
by anchoring to the BAC-based physical map generated at AGI, and
confirmed by a cytogenetic approaches. The current assembly is v1.4 and
is deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession
[AGAT00000000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AGAT00000000.1).
