**Assembly**
--------

The genome was sequenced and assembled at [Earlham Institute](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/) using PacBio HiFi reads (33x coverage) and Oxford Nanopore ultra-long reads (17x coverage) then scaffolded using Omni-C reads to generate a chromosome-scale assembly. This resource was produced as part of the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council's [Delivering Sustainable Wheat](https://designingfuturewheat.org.uk/) project.
