----------

Ensembl-plants displaying genes imported from GenBank entry linked to the assembly with accession [GCA\_963425845.1](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_963425845.1).

Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by ["International Livestock Research Institute"](https://www.ilri.org/).

Small RNA features, protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been
computed by [Ensembl-plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
