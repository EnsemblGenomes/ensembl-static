About *Fraxinus excelsior*
---------------------
Ash trees (genus *Fraxinus*, family Oleaceae) are widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but are being devastated in Europe by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, causing ash dieback, and in North America by the herbivorous beetle Agrilus planipennis.
