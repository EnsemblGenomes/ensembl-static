### Assembly

European ash (F. excelsior) was sequenced from a tree generated from self-pollination of a woodland tree in Gloucestershire, UK. The sequenced tree (Earth Trust accession number 2451S) appeared free of ash dieback (ADB) when sampled in 2013 and 2014, but showed symptoms in February 2016. The haploid genome size was measured by flow cytometry as 877.24 ± 1.41 megabase pairs (Mbp). Total genomic DNA was sequenced to 192× coverage. We assembled the genome into 89,514 nuclear scaffolds with an N50 (the length at which scaffolds include half the bases of the assembly) of 104 kilobase pairs (kbp), 26 mitochondrial scaffolds, and one plastid chromosome, where the non-N assembly constitutes 80.5% of the predicted genome size.
