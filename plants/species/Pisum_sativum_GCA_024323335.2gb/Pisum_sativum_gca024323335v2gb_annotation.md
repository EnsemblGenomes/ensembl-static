**Annotation**
----------

The annotation presented is derived from genes imported from the community GFF3 with the assembly accession [GCA\_024323335.2](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/GCA_024323335.2).

Plants displaying genes imported from [NCBI RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/Pisum_sativum/GCF_024323335.1-RS_2025_04.html) annotation release vGCF_024323335.1-RS_2025_04.html.

Genomic annotation was deposited along with initial assembly submission by ["Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"](https://english.im.cas.cn/).

Protein features, BLAST hits and cross-references have been computed by [Ensembl Plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/index.html).
