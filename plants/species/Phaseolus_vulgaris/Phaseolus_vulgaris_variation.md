### Variation

Variation from the European Variation Archive was [added](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?eva-study=PRJEB18671).

This was taken from whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of 29 cultivars of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), nine pools and 2 cultivated relatives of P. coccineus and P. acutifolius (https://ciat.cgiar.org/what-we-do/breeding-better-crops/beans/).
