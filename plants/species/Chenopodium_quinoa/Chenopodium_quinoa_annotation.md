### Annotation

Protein-coding genes were annotated using a combination of ab initio prediction and transcript evidence gathered from RNA sequenced from multiple tissues using both RNA-seq and PacBio isoform sequencing approaches. The obtained number of gene models is in line with sequenced tetraploid species. A majority (97.3%) of the 956 genes in the Plantae BUSCO dataset were identified in the annotation, which is suggestive of a complete assembly and annotation.

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://plants.ensembl.org/info/genome/annotation/repeat_features.html).There are: 2286474 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 99 Mb (7.4% of the genome); 331989 RepeatMasker features (with the nrTEplants library), covering 142 Mb (10.7% of the genome); 988319 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 314 Mb (23.5% of the genome).
