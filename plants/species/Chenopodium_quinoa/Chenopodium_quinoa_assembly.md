### Assembly

DNA extracted from leaf and flower tissue of a single plant was sequenced and assembled using single-molecule real-time technology from Pacific Biosciences and optical and chromosome-contact maps from BioNano Genomics and Dovetail Genomics. The assembly contains 3,486 scaffolds, with a scaffold N50 of 3.84 Mb and 90% of the assembled genome contained in 439 scaffolds. The total assembly size of 1.39Gb is similar to the reported size estimates of the quinoa genome (1.45â€“1.50 Gb). To combine scaffolds into pseudomolecules, an existing linkage map from quinoa was integrated with two new linkage maps. The resulting map of 6,403 unique markers spans a total length of 2,034 cM and consists of 18 linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of quinoa.
