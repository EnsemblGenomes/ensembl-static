About *Chenopodium quinoa*
--------------------------

*Chenopodium quinoa* (Quinoa) is a highly nutritious crop that is adapted to thrive in a wide range of agroecosystems. It was presumably first domesticated more than 7,000 years ago by pre-Columbian cultures and was known as the Inca ‘mother grain’. It is an allotetraploid (2n=4x=36). Quinoa has adapted to the high plains of the Andean Altiplano (>3,500 m above sea level), where it has developed tolerance to several abiotic stresses. Quinoa has gained international attention because of the nutritional value of its seeds, which are gluten-free, have a low glycaemic index, and contain an excellent balance of essential amino acids, fibre, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. It has the potential to provide a highly nutritious food source that can be grown on marginal lands not currently suitable for other major crops. This genome corresponds to coastal Chilean quinoa accession PI 614886, also known as NSL 106399 and QQ74.
