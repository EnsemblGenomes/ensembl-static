### Assembly

The genome was sequenced as a contribution to the [Multinational
Brassica Genome Sequencing
Project](https://www.brassica.info/resource/sequencing.php) and was
published in [August 2011](https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21873998).
The genomic sequence within this version of Ensembl includes 193 large
scaffolds assembled by [CAAS-IVF](https://brassicadb.org/brad/), which
have been orientated and assigned to pseudochromosomes using publicly
available genetic markers.
