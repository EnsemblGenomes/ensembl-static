### Annotation

Protein-coding genes and alternative spliced isoforms were annotated by combining evidence generated from RNA-seq/PacBio IsoSeq transcript mapping, homology-based protein mapping, and ab initio prediction. In total, 234.7 Gb of Illumina RNA-seq reads were collected from 31 samples at various development and physiological stages. PacBio IsoSeq libraries were constructed in order to generate 414,750 full-length and non-chimeric transcripts. In total, 89,477 protein-coding transcripts were annotated for 55,539 gene loci, with 69,455 transcripts (77.6%) having 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and 71,271 transcripts (79.7%) having 3′-UTR.
