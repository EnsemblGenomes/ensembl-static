### Annotation

The genome encodes 36,377 inferred protein-coding genes and 3,971 long non-coding RNAs. Annotation assessment with the Plantae BUSCO v2 dataset identified 96.5% complete gene models. Based on transcriptomic data from pooled tissues, 207 miRNA precursors were predicted. 

Repeats were annotated with the [Ensembl Genomes repeat feature pipeline](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/data/repeat_features). There are: 744,291 Low complexity (Dust) features, covering 22 Mb (4.3% of the genome); 187,134 RepeatMasker features (with the REdat library), covering 64 Mb (12.4% of the genome); 8,522 RepeatMasker features (with the RepBase library), covering 1 Mb (0.2% of the genome); 312,755 Tandem repeats (TRF) features, covering 28 Mb (5.5% of the genome).
