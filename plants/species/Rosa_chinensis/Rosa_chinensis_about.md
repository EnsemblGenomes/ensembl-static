About *Rosa chinensis*
-------------------------

Rose is the world’s most important ornamental plant, with economic, cultural and symbolic value. 
Roses are cultivated worldwide and sold as garden roses, cut flowers and potted plants, holding great symbolic and cultural value. 
Roses appeared as decoration on 5,000-year-old Asian pottery, and Romans cultivated roses for their flowers and essential oil.
Today, no ornamental plants have greater economic importance than roses. 
Roses are also used for scent production and for culinary purposes. 
This genome corresponds to a doubled haploid (2n=14) of Rosa chinensis derived from Chinese variety ‘Old Blush’. 
‘Old Blush’ (syn. Parsons’ Pink China) was brought to Europe and North America in the eighteenth century from China and is one of the most influential genotypes in the history of rose breeding.
