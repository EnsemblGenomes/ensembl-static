### Assembly

Two genotypes of *Panicum hallii* were sequenced using a whole genome
shotgun strategy at the DOE Joint Genome Institute (USA) and the
HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology (USA). Sequencing effort for
HAL2 included one Illumina 800 bp insert 2x250 fragment library
(150x) and a total of 89.5x of PACBIO reads (average subread length
11.8 kb). FIL2 sequencing was similar, with one Illiumina 500 bp insert
2x150 fragment library (100x) and a total of 95.87x of PACBIO reads
(average subread length 9.6 kb). Assembly was performed with MECAT and
polished using QUIVER. A 325,613-marker genetic map from shallow
resequencing of a RIL population was used to identify and correct
mis-joins in the assemblies.
