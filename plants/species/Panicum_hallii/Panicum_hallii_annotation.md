### Annotation

PERTRAN and PASA were used to produce 92,211 (HAL2) and 111,325 (FIL2)
transcript assemblies from ~1100 M (HAL2) and ~1200 M (FIL2) 2x150
paired-end Illumina RNA-seq reads. Loci were determined by transcript
assembly alignments and/or EXONERATE alignments of proteins from
*Arabidopsis thaliana*, soybean, Kitaake rice, sorghum, foxtail millet,
*Brachypodium distachyon*, grape and Swiss-Prot proteomes. Gene models
were predicted by a combination of methods. The best-scoring predictions
for each locus were selected and penalized if overlapped with repeats.
High-confidence transcripts were called. Gene models with >30%
transposable element Pfam domains were culled, as well as gene models
with a short single exon, without protein domains or with weak
expression.
