## Wheat assemblies

Ensembl Plants hosts the [RefSeq v1.0 assembly](http://plants.ensembl.org/Wheat) from the IWGSC, including:

- The IWGSC RefSeq v1.1 gene annotation, with links to [wheat expression browser](http://www.wheat-expression.com) and [KnetMiner](https://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk/Triticum_aestivum/)
- [17 wheat cultivars](/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Strains?db=core) from the [10+ genome project](http://www.10wheatgenomes.com) and other sources including comparative analysis across the different lines
- ~90 million variants from the [Watkins Landrace Wheat Collection](https://www.jic.ac.uk/blog/the-a-e-watkins-landrace-collection-of-bread-wheat-who-was-ae-watkins/)
- Axiom 35K, 820K SNP arrays from [CerealsDB](https://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/cerealgenomics/CerealsDB/index.php), including QTL links in selected cases and Linkage Disequilibrium display - see QTL example [here](https://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Variation/Explore?r=5A:438266461-438267461;v=BA00617086;vdb=variation;vf=264386). 820K variants have been lifted over to the chromosomal level 10+ wheat cultivars
- EMS-induced mutations from sequenced TILLING populations of Cadenza (coding regions) and Kronos (coding regions and promoters)
- Inter-Homeologous Variants (IHVs) between the A, B and D genome components
- Chromosome specific KASP markers from the Nottingham BBSRC Wheat Research Centre
- Whole genome alignments to rice, brachypodium and barley
- Polyploid view enabled, allowing users to view alignments among multiple wheat components [simultaneously](http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Location/MultiPolyploid?db=core;g=TraesCS3D02G273600;r=3D:379535906-379539827;r1=3B:495135630-495139551:1;r2=3A:503751489-503755410:1;s1=Triticum_aestivum--3B;s2=Triticum_aestivum--3A)
- Durum wheat 35K, 90K, 820K and TaBW280K variants
- Chromosome and centromere data can be viewed [here](/Triticum_aestivum/Location/Genome)
- [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) protein predictions have been added to all transcripts - see an example [here](http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Transcript/AFDB?db=core;g=TraesCS3D02G273600;r=3D:379535906-379539827;t=TraesCS3D02G273600.1)
